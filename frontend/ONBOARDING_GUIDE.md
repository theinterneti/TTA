# Welcome to the TTA Therapeutic Gaming Project! 🎮💚

Welcome to the **Therapeutic Technology Assistant (TTA)** development team! We're thrilled to have you join us in building innovative therapeutic gaming experiences that make a real difference in people's lives.

## 🌟 About TTA: Therapeutic Gaming That Heals

TTA is not just another gaming application—it's a **therapeutic intervention platform** that uses interactive gaming experiences to support mental health, emotional well-being, and personal growth. Our work directly impacts vulnerable populations, including individuals dealing with anxiety, depression, trauma, and other mental health challenges.

### Our Mission
We create **safe, engaging, and therapeutically effective** digital experiences that:
- Provide emotional support through interactive therapeutic characters
- Offer guided therapeutic activities in calming virtual environments
- Track progress toward therapeutic goals
- Ensure immediate crisis intervention when needed
- Maintain the highest standards of patient privacy and safety

**Your work as a frontend developer is crucial** to delivering these life-changing therapeutic experiences to those who need them most.

## 📚 Your Documentation Hub: Everything You Need to Know

We've created a comprehensive documentation hub specifically for frontend developers at:
```
/home/thein/recovered-tta-storytelling/frontend/docs/
```

This hub contains **everything you need** to understand the project, APIs, therapeutic requirements, and development standards—all organized for easy navigation without requiring backend system access.

## 🚀 Your First Day: Getting Started Checklist

### Step 1: Read the Essential Documentation (30-45 minutes)

**Start with these three critical files in order:**

1. **📖 Main Documentation Hub**
   ```
   /home/thein/recovered-tta-storytelling/frontend/docs/README.md
   ```
   - Complete project overview and navigation guide
   - Understanding of therapeutic gaming architecture
   - Development phases and priorities

2. **🛠️ Development Environment Setup**
   ```
   /home/thein/recovered-tta-storytelling/frontend/docs/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md
   ```
   - Prerequisites and installation instructions
   - Environment configuration
   - Project structure and development workflow

3. **⚡ API Quick Reference**
   ```
   /home/thein/recovered-tta-storytelling/frontend/docs/API_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
   ```
   - Most commonly used API endpoints
   - Authentication flows
   - WebSocket communication patterns

### Step 2: Set Up Your Development Environment (15-30 minutes)

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd /home/thein/recovered-tta-storytelling/frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create your environment configuration
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your development settings

# Start the development server
npm start
```

**Verify your setup works:**
- ✅ Application loads at `http://localhost:3000`
- ✅ Login page displays without errors
- ✅ Navigation between pages works
- ✅ Crisis support button is visible and functional

### Step 3: Explore the Application Structure (15-20 minutes)

Take a tour of the existing React application:
```
frontend/src/
├── components/common/     # Shared UI components
├── pages/                # Page components (Login, Dashboard, etc.)
├── store/                # Redux state management
├── services/             # API service layer
├── types/                # TypeScript type definitions
└── App.tsx              # Main application component
```

**Key files to examine:**
- `src/App.tsx` - Main routing and authentication logic
- `src/components/common/CrisisSupport.tsx` - Critical safety component
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` - Main patient interface
- `src/store/store.ts` - Redux store configuration

## 🧠 Critical Concepts: Understanding Therapeutic Gaming

### Patient-Centered Design Philosophy
Every interface decision must prioritize:
- **Patient Safety**: Crisis detection and intervention capabilities
- **Therapeutic Effectiveness**: Supporting mental health goals
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all users
- **Privacy Protection**: HIPAA-compliant data handling

### Core Application Flow
1. **Secure Authentication** → Patient logs in with therapeutic context
2. **Character Selection** → Patient chooses therapeutic companion
3. **World Entry** → Patient enters calming virtual environments
4. **Therapeutic Sessions** → Structured gaming experiences with progress tracking
5. **Crisis Support** → Always-available emergency intervention resources

### Key Therapeutic Components
- **Therapeutic Characters**: AI-powered companions that provide emotional support
- **Virtual Worlds**: Carefully designed environments for specific therapeutic goals
- **Session Management**: Structured therapeutic gaming experiences
- **Progress Tracking**: Measurement of therapeutic outcomes and milestones
- **Crisis Detection**: Real-time monitoring for intervention needs

## 🚨 Critical Requirements: Non-Negotiable Standards

### 🛡️ Patient Safety (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
- **Crisis Support**: Must be accessible from every screen within 2 clicks
- **Crisis Detection**: Monitor for concerning language or behavior patterns
- **Emergency Protocols**: Immediate access to crisis hotlines and resources
- **Audit Trails**: Log all crisis-related interactions for clinical review

**Crisis Support Resources:**
- National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: **988**
- Crisis Text Line: **Text HOME to 741741**
- Emergency Services: **911**

### 🔐 HIPAA Compliance & Data Protection
- **No Logging**: Never log sensitive patient data in console or files
- **Secure Storage**: Use encrypted storage for authentication tokens
- **Data Minimization**: Only collect and store necessary therapeutic data
- **Access Controls**: Implement proper user authentication and authorization

### ♿ Accessibility Standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Color Contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators and logical tab order

### 🎯 Therapeutic Effectiveness
- **Evidence-Based Design**: Follow established therapeutic intervention patterns
- **Progress Measurement**: Track and display therapeutic goal advancement
