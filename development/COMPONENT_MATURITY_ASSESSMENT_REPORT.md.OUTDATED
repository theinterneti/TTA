# ⚠️ OUTDATED - DO NOT USE

**This file contains INCORRECT data showing 0% coverage for all components.**

**Use instead**: [COMPONENT_MATURITY_ASSESSMENT_CORRECTED.md](COMPONENT_MATURITY_ASSESSMENT_CORRECTED.md)

**What happened**: Initial analysis used `uvx pytest` instead of `uv run pytest`, causing false 0% readings.

**Corrected findings**: 3 components at 100% coverage, 1 at 69.7%, much better than reported.

# TTA Component Maturity Assessment Report (OUTDATED)

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Assessment Type**: Comprehensive Component Analysis
**Components Analyzed**: 12
**Status**: ❌ OUTDATED - INCORRECT DATA

---

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive analysis of all 12 TTA components reveals that **all components are currently in early Development stage** with significant work required before any can be promoted to Staging. The analysis identified **6,520+ total linting issues**, **0% test coverage across all components**, and **missing documentation** for several components.

### Key Findings

- ✅ **Documentation**: 8/12 components have README files
- ❌ **Test Coverage**: 0/12 components meet 70% threshold (all at 0%)
- ❌ **Code Quality**: 0/12 components pass all quality checks
- ❌ **Staging Ready**: 0/12 components ready for promotion

### Recommended Approach

Given the current state, we recommend a **phased, incremental approach**:
1. **Phase 1**: Focus on Neo4j (pilot) - achieve 70% coverage, fix critical issues
2. **Phase 2**: Address Core Infrastructure (Docker, Carbon)
3. **Phase 3**: Systematic rollout following dependency order
