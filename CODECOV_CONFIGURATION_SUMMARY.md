# Codecov Configuration - Setup Complete ‚úÖ

**Date**: 2025-10-29
**Status**: ‚úÖ Repository Configured, Awaiting Token Setup

---

## üéØ What Was Done

### 1. Created Codecov Configuration (`codecov.yml`)

Comprehensive configuration including:
- ‚úÖ Project-level coverage targets (70%)
- ‚úÖ Patch coverage requirements (60%)
- ‚úÖ Component-specific targets aligned with TTA maturity workflow
- ‚úÖ PR comment layout
- ‚úÖ Ignore patterns for tests/scripts/docs
- ‚úÖ Coverage flags for unit/integration/e2e tests

**Key Targets**:
- Development: 70% (staging promotion threshold)
- Staging: 80% (production candidate)
- Production: 85% (battle-tested)

### 2. Created GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/coverage.yml`)

Automated workflow that:
- ‚úÖ Runs on push to main/staging/develop
- ‚úÖ Runs on all pull requests
- ‚úÖ Spins up Redis and Neo4j services
- ‚úÖ Executes full test suite with coverage
- ‚úÖ Generates XML, HTML, and terminal reports
- ‚úÖ Uploads coverage to Codecov
- ‚úÖ Comments coverage summary on PRs
- ‚úÖ Creates downloadable HTML artifacts

**Features**:
- Service health checks (Redis, Neo4j)
- UV package manager with caching
- Branch and line coverage measurement
- Automatic PR comments with coverage summary
- GitHub Step Summary with quick metrics

### 3. Updated Coverage Configuration (`pyproject.toml`)

Added XML output configuration:
```toml
[tool.coverage.xml]
output = "coverage.xml"
```

Already had solid coverage configuration:
- Source: `src/`
- Branch coverage enabled
- Appropriate exclusions (tests, pycache, venv)
- HTML output to `htmlcov/`

### 4. Created Documentation

**Three documentation files**:

1. **`docs/CODECOV_SETUP.md`** (Comprehensive)
   - Complete setup instructions
   - How Codecov works
   - Using the dashboard
   - Local coverage reports
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Integration with TTA workflows
   - Best practices

2. **`CODECOV_QUICK_START.md`** (Developer-Focused)
   - TL;DR for developers
   - Quick reference
   - Common workflows
   - Pro tips
   - Coverage interpretation

3. **Coverage Badge in README**
   - Added Codecov badge to main README
   - Positioned prominently with other CI badges

## üîß Setup Required (One-Time Action Needed)

### Add Codecov Token to GitHub Secrets

**You need to do this ONCE**:

1. **Get Your Upload Token**
   - Visit: <https://app.codecov.io/gh/theinterneti/TTA>
   - Go to: Settings ‚Üí General
   - Copy the upload token (starts with `981b16ab-...`)

2. **Add to GitHub Secrets**
   - Go to: <https://github.com/theinterneti/TTA/settings/secrets/actions>
   - Click: "New repository secret"
   - Name: `CODECOV_TOKEN`
   - Value: [paste your token]
   - Click: "Add secret"

3. **That's It!**
   - Coverage reports will automatically upload on next push
   - No code changes needed
   - Workflow is already configured

---

## üìä Current Coverage Status

**Baseline** (2025-10-29):
- Overall: **28.33%**
- Target: **70%** (for development/staging promotion)
- Gap: **41.67%** to reach target

**Component Status**:
- ‚úÖ `observability_integration`: 75.93% (STAGING READY!)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `orchestration`: 68.07% (2% from target)
- üîÑ `player_experience`: 56.34% (needs work)
- üî¥ `agent_orchestration`: 17.88% (critical gap)

See `COVERAGE_BASELINE_REPORT.md` for detailed breakdown.

## üöÄ What Happens Next

### Automatic Coverage Tracking

Once the token is added, every push and PR will:

1. ‚úÖ Run full test suite with coverage
2. ‚úÖ Upload results to Codecov
3. ‚úÖ Comment on PRs with coverage summary
4. ‚úÖ Show coverage badge in README
5. ‚úÖ Track coverage trends over time

### Developer Workflow

Developers can:

1. **View Coverage Locally**:
   ```bash
   uv run pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
   open htmlcov/index.html
   ```

2. **Check Coverage Before Pushing**:
   ```bash
   uv run pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
   ```

3. **View on Codecov Dashboard**:
   - <https://app.codecov.io/gh/theinterneti/TTA>
   - Line-by-line coverage
   - Historical trends
   - Component breakdowns

### Component Promotion

Coverage validation is now automated:

```bash
# Promote to staging (requires 70% coverage)
python scripts/workflow/spec_to_production.py \
  --spec specs/observability.md \
  --component observability_integration \
  --target staging
```
