## Technical Improvements Made

### 1. Neo4j Schema Manager Enhancements
```python
def is_connected(self) -> bool:
    """Check if connected to Neo4j database with health validation."""
    if not self.driver:
        return False
    try:
        with self.driver.session() as session:
            session.run("RETURN 1")
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Neo4j connection check failed: {e}")
        return False
```

### 2. Data Model Serialization
Added comprehensive serialization support to all data models:
- `TherapeuticProgress.from_json()` and `to_json()` methods
- `TherapeuticGoal.from_dict()` method
- `CompletedIntervention.from_dict()` method
- `CopingStrategy.from_dict()` method

### 3. Redis Cache Method Fixes
Fixed missing `_execute_with_metrics` method in `CacheInvalidationManager`:
```python
def _execute_with_metrics(self, operation: str, func, *args, **kwargs):
    """Execute Redis operation with metrics tracking."""
    start_time = time.time()
    try:
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        response_time = time.time() - start_time
        # Record metrics based on operation type
        self.connection_manager.metrics.record_operation(operation, response_time)
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        self.connection_manager.metrics.record_error()
        raise
```

### 4. Neo4j Property Handling
Enhanced character creation to handle complex properties:
```python
def create_character(self, character_id: str, name: str, **properties) -> bool:
    # Convert complex properties to JSON strings for Neo4j storage
    processed_properties = {}
    for key, value in properties.items():
        if isinstance(value, (dict, list)):
            processed_properties[key] = json.dumps(value)
        else:
            processed_properties[key] = value
```
