## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Are Tests Failing?

**Hypothesis 1: Code Quality Issues Breaking Tests**
- Linting errors may include undefined names (F821)
- Type errors may indicate incorrect function signatures
- These could cause import errors or runtime failures

**Hypothesis 2: Missing Dependencies or Configuration**
- Tests may require specific environment setup
- Service configuration may be incorrect
- Test fixtures may be missing

**Hypothesis 3: Actual Test Failures**
- Code changes may have broken existing functionality
- Tests may need to be updated for new code

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Fix code quality issues first (lint, format, type)
2. Re-run tests to see if they pass
3. If still failing, investigate specific test failures

---

## Estimated Effort

| Issue Category | Estimated Time | Approach |
|----------------|----------------|----------|
| **Formatting (Black/isort)** | 5-10 minutes | Auto-fix with `black` and `isort` |
| **Linting (Ruff)** | 30-60 minutes | Mix of auto-fix and manual fixes |
| **Type Errors (mypy)** | 2-4 hours | Manual type annotations |
| **Test Failures** | 1-3 hours | Debug and fix (after code quality) |
| **Security Issues** | 1-2 hours | Review and fix/suppress |
| **SBOM Generation** | 30 minutes | Fix command syntax |

**Total Estimated Effort:** 5-10 hours
