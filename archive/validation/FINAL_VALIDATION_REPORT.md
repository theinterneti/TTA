## Known Warnings (Non-Critical)

The following warnings appear but don't prevent system operation:

1. **Missing personalization_engine module**
   - Uses mock implementations
   - Expected for development environment

2. **Neo4j authentication failure**
   - Falls back to Redis for user storage
   - Credentials may need configuration

3. **Missing agents module**
   - Uses fallback agent implementations
   - Expected for development environment

4. **Agent orchestration not fully available**
   - Chat uses fallback responses
   - Some agent components not fully configured

**Impact:** Graceful degradation - system runs with fallback implementations.
