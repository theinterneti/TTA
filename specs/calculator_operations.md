# Calculator Operations Component

## Overview
Simple calculator operations component for testing async workflow integration (Phase 2).

## Purpose
This component provides basic arithmetic operations and serves as a test case for validating the async OpenHands workflow implementation.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-1**: Addition operation that takes two integers and returns their sum
- **FR-2**: Subtraction operation that takes two integers and returns their difference
- **FR-3**: Multiplication operation that takes two integers and returns their product
- **FR-4**: Division operation that takes two integers and returns their quotient
- **FR-5**: Division by zero should raise a ValueError with appropriate message

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-1**: All operations should have O(1) time complexity
- **NFR-2**: Functions should be pure (no side effects)
- **NFR-3**: Type hints should be provided for all parameters and return values

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage
- **Target Coverage**: 80% minimum
- **Test all operations**: add, subtract, multiply, divide
- **Test edge cases**: division by zero
- **Test type handling**: integer inputs and outputs (float for division)

### Test Scenarios
1. **Addition Tests**
   - Positive numbers
   - Negative numbers
   - Zero

2. **Subtraction Tests**
   - Positive result
   - Negative result
   - Zero result

3. **Multiplication Tests**
   - Positive numbers
   - Negative numbers
   - Zero

4. **Division Tests**
   - Normal division
   - Division by zero (should raise ValueError)
   - Negative numbers

## Implementation Notes
- Keep functions simple and focused
- Use descriptive parameter names
- Include docstrings for all functions
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines

## Success Criteria
- All functions implemented correctly
- Test coverage â‰¥ 80%
- All tests passing
- No linting errors
- Type checking passes
