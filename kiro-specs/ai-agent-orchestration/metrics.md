# Messaging Metrics for Agent Orchestration Specification

**Status**: ✅ OPERATIONAL **Messaging Metrics System Implemented** (2024-12-19)
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Implementation**: src/agent_orchestration/metrics/
**Owner**: tta-dev-team@example.com
**Reviewer**: tta-dev-team@example.com

## Overview

The Messaging Metrics for Agent Orchestration system provides comprehensive metrics collection and monitoring for the message coordination layer. This system delivers production-ready observability with queue monitoring, delivery tracking, retry statistics, and performance analytics for reliable agent orchestration system monitoring and operational excellence.

**Current Implementation Status**: ✅ **OPERATIONAL** (December 2024)

- Complete messaging metrics collection and monitoring system
- Queue length monitoring per agent and priority level
- Dead Letter Queue tracking and alerting capabilities
- Comprehensive retry statistics and delivery success/failure tracking
- In-memory metrics with snapshot capabilities for real-time monitoring
- Foundation for Prometheus/OpenTelemetry integration and threshold alerting

The system serves as the comprehensive observability and monitoring platform for the AI agent orchestration messaging infrastructure.

## Metrics

- Queue lengths per agent and priority
  - Gauge: messaging.queue_length{agent="<type:inst>", priority=<1|5|9>}
- Dead Letter Queue counts
  - Gauge: messaging.dlq_length{agent="<type:inst>"}
- Retry statistics
  - Counter: messaging.nacks.total
  - Counter: messaging.retries.scheduled.total
  - Counter: messaging.permanent_failures.total
  - Gauge: messaging.retries.last_backoff_seconds
- Delivery success/failure
  - Counter: messaging.delivered.ok
  - Counter: messaging.delivered.error

## Access

The RedisMessageCoordinator maintains an in-memory MessageMetrics instance.
Call `coord.metrics.snapshot()` to retrieve a dict snapshot of current values.

## Future Work

- Export metrics via Prometheus/OpenTelemetry exporters
- Emit events on threshold breaches (e.g., DLQ growth)
- Persist rolling aggregates to Redis for multi-process visibility
