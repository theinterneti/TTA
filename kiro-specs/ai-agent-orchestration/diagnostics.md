# Diagnostics and Monitoring for Agent Orchestration Specification

**Status**: ✅ OPERATIONAL **Diagnostics and Monitoring System Implemented** (2024-12-19)
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Implementation**: src/agent_orchestration/diagnostics/
**Owner**: tta-dev-team@example.com
**Reviewer**: tta-dev-team@example.com

## Overview

The Diagnostics and Monitoring for Agent Orchestration system provides comprehensive health monitoring, metrics collection, and operational diagnostics for the AI agent orchestration platform. This system delivers production-ready observability with FastAPI-based diagnostics endpoints, Prometheus metrics export, auto-recovery logging, and threshold-based alerting for reliable operational excellence.

**Current Implementation Status**: ✅ **OPERATIONAL** (December 2024)

- Complete diagnostics and monitoring system with FastAPI-based server
- Health endpoints, metrics collection, and Prometheus export capabilities
- Auto-recovery logging and periodic metrics polling for operational visibility
- Threshold-based warning system with configurable alerting thresholds
- Resource monitoring with CPU, memory, and GPU tracking capabilities
- Production-ready observability infrastructure with graceful degradation

The system serves as the comprehensive operational monitoring and diagnostics platform for the AI agent orchestration infrastructure.

## Diagnostics Endpoint

A lightweight FastAPI-based server is started by the Agent Orchestration component (on 127.0.0.1 and the configured port).

Endpoints:

- GET /health: basic status for the component
- GET /metrics: returns a JSON object including:
  - messages: `MessageMetrics.snapshot()` from the RedisMessageCoordinator
  - performance: per-agent step stats (p50, p95, avg, error_rate)
  - resources: latest ResourceManager snapshot (CPU, memory, GPU when available)
- GET /metrics-prom: Prometheus metrics export (requires prometheus_client), including:
  - Counters: deliveries, delivery errors, retries, permanent failures
  - Gauges: queue length (by agent, priority), DLQ length (by agent), step error rate (by agent)
  - Summary: backoff seconds
  - Histogram: step duration (ms) labeled by agent

## Planned Enhancements

- Configuration schema validation for agent_orchestration.resources and agent_orchestration.monitoring keys (High priority)
- Test infrastructure tasks: introduce test markers and Testcontainers for Redis (High priority)
- Resource-aware load balancing in MessageCoordinator (Medium priority)
- Diagnostics ring-buffer for /metrics-history (Low priority)

Notes:

- If FastAPI or uvicorn are not available, the diagnostics server is skipped gracefully.
- Diagnostics server is gated by `agent_orchestration.diagnostics.enabled` (default: false). When disabled, server startup is skipped and a log entry is emitted.

## Auto-Recovery Logging

On startup, the component invokes `recover_pending(None)` and logs a total recovered count and per-agent recovery counts (type:instance) for observability.

## Periodic Metrics Polling

The component runs a background task that:

- Every 5 seconds, scans Redis for queue (audit) and per-priority ready zset keys
- Updates gauges: queue lengths by priority and DLQ lengths for each agent instance

## Threshold-Based Warning Foundation

Basic thresholds (configurable via config):

- `agent_orchestration.metrics.dlq_warn_threshold` (default: 10)
- `agent_orchestration.metrics.retry_spike_warn_threshold` (default: 20)

If DLQ length exceeds the threshold for an agent, a warning is logged.
If retry activity between two polling intervals exceeds the retry spike threshold, a warning is logged.
