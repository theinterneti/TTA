# Narrative Arc Orchestration Specification

**Status**: ðŸš§ IN_PROGRESS **Narrative Systems Integrated** (2024-12-19)
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Implementation**: src/narrative_orchestration/
**Owner**: tta-dev-team@example.com
**Reviewer**: tta-dev-team@example.com

## Overview

The Narrative Arc Orchestration system manages the dynamic creation, adaptation, and progression of therapeutic narrative experiences. This system coordinates between player choices, therapeutic objectives, and narrative coherence to create meaningful and therapeutically effective storytelling experiences.

**Current Implementation Status**: ðŸš§ **IN_PROGRESS** (December 2024)
- Dynamic narrative generation with therapeutic integration
- Real-time story adaptation based on player choices and therapeutic needs
- Integration with knowledge management for narrative coherence
- Multi-arc narrative progression with therapeutic milestone tracking
- Character development integration with therapeutic goals
- Performance optimization for seamless narrative flow

The system serves as the creative intelligence layer that transforms therapeutic objectives into engaging narrative experiences while maintaining story coherence and therapeutic effectiveness.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR-1: Dynamic Narrative Generation**
- WHEN generating therapeutic narrative content
- THEN the system SHALL provide dynamic story creation based on therapeutic objectives
- AND support real-time narrative adaptation to player choices
- AND enable coherent multi-arc narrative progression

**FR-2: Therapeutic Integration**
- WHEN integrating therapeutic objectives with narrative content
- THEN the system SHALL provide seamless therapeutic goal incorporation
- AND support therapeutic milestone tracking through narrative progression
- AND enable personalized therapeutic approach adaptation within stories

**FR-3: Narrative Coherence Management**
- WHEN managing narrative coherence across sessions
- THEN the system SHALL provide consistent story world maintenance
- AND support character development continuity
- AND enable cross-session narrative state persistence

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR-1: Performance**
- Response time: <200ms for narrative generation
- Throughput: 500+ concurrent narrative sessions
- Resource constraints: Optimized for real-time story adaptation

**NFR-2: Creativity and Engagement**
- Narrative quality: Engaging and therapeutically meaningful stories
- Adaptation: Dynamic response to player choices and therapeutic needs
- Coherence: Consistent story world and character development
- Personalization: Tailored narrative experiences for individual therapeutic goals

**NFR-3: Reliability**
- Availability: 99.9% uptime for narrative services
- Scalability: Multi-session narrative orchestration support
- Error handling: Graceful narrative generation failure recovery
- Data integrity: Consistent narrative state and progression tracking

## Technical Design

### Architecture Description
AI-powered narrative orchestration system that dynamically generates and adapts therapeutic stories based on player choices, therapeutic objectives, and narrative coherence requirements. Integrates with knowledge management and therapeutic systems for comprehensive story experiences.

### Component Interaction Details
- **NarrativeOrchestrator**: Main narrative generation and adaptation controller
- **StoryGenerator**: AI-powered dynamic story content creation
- **TherapeuticIntegrator**: Therapeutic objective incorporation into narratives
- **CoherenceManager**: Narrative consistency and world state management
- **CharacterDeveloper**: Character progression and development coordination

### Data Flow Description
1. Therapeutic objective and player context analysis
2. Dynamic narrative generation and story arc planning
3. Real-time story adaptation based on player choices
4. Therapeutic milestone integration and tracking
5. Narrative coherence validation and maintenance
6. Cross-session narrative state persistence and continuity

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- **Test Files**: tests/unit/narrative_orchestration/
- **Coverage Target**: 85%
- **Critical Test Scenarios**: Narrative generation, therapeutic integration, coherence management

### Integration Tests
