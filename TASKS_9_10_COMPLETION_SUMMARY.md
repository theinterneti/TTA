## Technical Implementation Details

### Core Components Implemented:

#### Progress Tracking Service
```python
class ProgressTrackingService:
    - compute_progress_summary()           # Comprehensive progress analysis
    - detect_and_update_milestones()      # Enhanced milestone detection
    - generate_progress_insights()        # Sophisticated recommendations
    - generate_therapeutic_effectiveness_report()  # Clinical assessment
    - celebrate_milestone_achievement()    # Achievement celebration
    - get_visualization_data()            # Progress visualization
```

#### Player Experience Manager
```python
class PlayerExperienceManager:
    - get_player_dashboard()              # Dashboard data aggregation
    - get_recommendations()               # Combined recommendation system
    - process_player_feedback()           # Feedback processing and adaptation
    - detect_crisis_and_get_resources()   # Crisis detection and support
    - create_session()                    # Session management proxy
    - add_progress_marker()               # Progress tracking proxy
```
