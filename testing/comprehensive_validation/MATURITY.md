- Status: ✅ **ACCEPTABLE** (minor warning in non-critical simulation code)
- Auto-fixed: 36 issues

**Type Checking (pyright)**:
- Errors: 0
- Warnings: 0
- Status: ✅ **PASS**

**Security (bandit)**:

## Known Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Simulated Data**: Uses simulated narrative data instead of live TTA system integration
   - **Impact**: Low (demonstrates framework capabilities)
   - **Mitigation**: Clearly documented in README
   - **Future**: Integrate with live TTA system

2. **No Unit Tests**: Testing tool doesn't have traditional unit tests
   - **Impact**: Low (alternative validation through successful execution)
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive execution validation
   - **Future**: Add unit tests for metric calculation logic

3. **Single Linting Warning**: PLR0911 (too many return statements)
   - **Impact**: Minimal (in simulation function only)
   - **Mitigation**: Acceptable for simulation code
   - **Future**: Refactor if needed

### Blockers

**None** - Component is ready for staging promotion

## Staging Deployment Considerations

### Deployment Requirements

**Environment**:
- Python 3.12+ runtime
- Write access to `testing/results/narrative_coherence_validation/`
- Standard TTA testing framework

**Configuration**:
- No environment-specific configuration required
- Quality targets configurable via code

**Monitoring**:
- Log output to standard logging system
- Report generation success/failure tracking

### Staging Usage

**Recommended Schedule**:
- Weekly validation runs for quality monitoring
- Before major releases for production readiness check
- After significant narrative system changes

**Integration**:
- Can be integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- Can be run manually for ad-hoc validation
- Can be scheduled via cron/systemd timer

## Promotion Justification

### Why Promote to Staging?

1. **Complete Functionality**: All planned features implemented and working
2. **High Code Quality**: Clean code with minimal warnings, 0 type errors
3. **Well Documented**: Comprehensive README and inline documentation
4. **Validated Integration**: Successfully executed with valid outputs
