Excellence-Focused Narrative Quality Assessment for TTA

This module enhances the existing narrative analysis systems to meet higher
quality targets: narrative coherence ≥8.5/10, therapeutic relevance ≥8.0/10,
user engagement ≥8.5/10. It provides advanced quality metrics, automated
analysis, and detailed reporting for therapeutic storytelling excellence.

Key Features:
- Advanced narrative coherence analysis with excellence targets
- Therapeutic relevance assessment with clinical validation
- User engagement measurement with behavioral indicators
- Automated quality scoring with detailed breakdowns
- Excellence-focused recommendations and improvement suggestions
