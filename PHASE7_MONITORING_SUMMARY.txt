================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

Immediate (Next 1 Hour):
  1. Monitor engine execution via tail -f phase7_execution.log
  2. Watch for task completions in logs
  3. Collect generated artifacts as they're created
  4. Track execution progress

Short-term (Next 24 Hours):
  1. Run code quality validation (tests, coverage, linting, type checking)
  2. Verify all tests pass
  3. Check code coverage ≥70%
  4. Review generated code

Medium-term (Next 7 Days):
  1. Integrate artifacts into codebase
  2. Create commits by category
  3. Update PR #66
  4. Create final comprehensive report

================================================================================
SUCCESS CRITERIA
================================================================================

✅ Execution:       All 47 tasks submitted and queued
✅ Engine:          Running with 5 workers
✅ Monitoring:      Infrastructure in place
⏳ Processing:      Tasks being processed
⏳ Completion:      All tasks reach 'completed' status
⏳ Quality:         Generated code passes all checks
⏳ Integration:     Artifacts integrated into codebase
⏳ Documentation:   Final report with lessons learned

================================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES
================================================================================

Architecture:
  - OpenHands execution engine uses in-memory task queue
  - Tasks are processed by engine running in background
  - Monitoring is done via log files and artifact collection
  - Generated artifacts are written to disk

Monitoring Strategy:
  1. Log Monitoring: Watch phase7_execution.log for task processing
  2. Artifact Collection: Look for new files created by completed tasks
  3. Batch Results: Track task IDs in batch result files
  4. Quality Validation: Run tests and checks on generated code

Expected Timeline:
  - Execution: ~1 hour (engine running time)
  - Validation: ~24 hours (quality checks)
  - Integration: ~7 days (artifact integration and final report)
