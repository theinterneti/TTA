## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Execution (Current - 1 Hour)
**Objective:** Execute all 47 tasks through OpenHands engine

**Status:** ✅ In Progress
- Engine running with 5 workers
- All 41 tasks queued
- Monitoring infrastructure active

**Expected Completion:** 16:43 UTC (1 hour from start)

### Phase 2: Validation (Next 24 Hours)
**Objective:** Validate code quality of generated artifacts

**Tasks:**
1. Collect generated test files
2. Run test suite
3. Check code coverage
4. Run linting checks
5. Type checking
6. Security scanning

**Expected Completion:** 2025-10-26

### Phase 3: Integration (Next 7 Days)
**Objective:** Integrate results into codebase

**Tasks:**
1. Review all generated files
2. Organize into proper directories
3. Create commits by category
4. Update PR #66
5. Create final comprehensive report

**Expected Completion:** 2025-11-01

## Monitoring Commands

### Real-time Engine Monitoring
```bash
# Watch engine logs
tail -f phase7_execution.log

# Count task completions
grep -c "Task completed" phase7_execution.log

# Count task failures
grep -c "Task.*failed" phase7_execution.log

# View recent activity
tail -50 phase7_execution.log
```

### Artifact Collection
```bash
# Find new test files
find tests/ -name 'test_*.py' -type f -newer batch1_results.json

# Check for modified source files
git status

# View all changes
git diff src/
```

### Quality Validation
```bash
# Run tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Check coverage
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term

# Lint code
uv run ruff check src/ tests/

# Type checking
uv run pyright src/

# Security scan
uv run detect-secrets scan
```

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Tasks Submitted | 47 | ✅ 41/47 |
| Engine Running | Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Workers Active | 5 | ✅ 5 |
| Execution Time | ~1 hour | ⏳ In progress |
| Success Rate | 100% | ⏳ Pending |
| Test Coverage | ≥70% | ⏳ Pending |

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 1 Hour)
1. Monitor engine execution
2. Watch for task completions in logs
3. Collect generated artifacts
4. Track execution progress

### Short-term (Next 24 Hours)
1. Run code quality validation
2. Verify all tests pass
3. Check code coverage
4. Review generated code

### Medium-term (Next 7 Days)
1. Integrate artifacts into codebase
2. Create commits by category
3. Update PR #66
4. Create final report

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **Execution:** All 47 tasks submitted and queued  
✅ **Engine:** Running with 5 workers  
✅ **Monitoring:** Infrastructure in place  
⏳ **Processing:** Tasks being processed  
⏳ **Completion:** All tasks reach 'completed' status  
⏳ **Quality:** Generated code passes all checks  
⏳ **Integration:** Artifacts integrated into codebase  
⏳ **Documentation:** Final report with lessons learned  

---

## Important Notes

### Architecture
The OpenHands execution engine uses an **in-memory task queue**. This means:
- Tasks are processed by the engine running in the background
- Monitoring is done via log files and artifact collection
- Results are stored in memory during execution
- Generated artifacts are written to disk

### Monitoring Strategy
1. **Log Monitoring:** Watch `phase7_execution.log` for task processing
2. **Artifact Collection:** Look for new files created by completed tasks
3. **Batch Results:** Track task IDs in batch result files
4. **Quality Validation:** Run tests and checks on generated code

### Expected Timeline
- **Execution:** ~1 hour (engine running time)
- **Validation:** ~24 hours (quality checks)
- **Integration:** ~7 days (artifact integration and final report)
