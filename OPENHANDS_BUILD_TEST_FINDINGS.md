# OpenHands Component Build Test - Detailed Findings

**Date:** 2025-10-27  
**Test Objective:** Use OpenHands to build a practical Redis Connection Pool Manager component  
**OpenHands Version:** 0.59  
**Status:** ❌ **FAILED - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

---

## Executive Summary

Attempted to use the validated OpenHands integration to build a production-ready Redis Connection Pool Manager component for TTA. The test revealed **critical bugs in OpenHands 0.59** that prevent it from executing tasks successfully:

1. **Permission Error:** `.openhands` directory permission issues (RESOLVED)
2. **Condensation Loop Bug:** Agent gets stuck in infinite condensation loop (BLOCKING)
3. **No File Generation:** Even after 180 seconds, no files are created

**Conclusion:** OpenHands 0.59 has fundamental execution bugs that make it unsuitable for production use in its current state.

## Test Configuration

### Task Description

Create a comprehensive Redis Connection Pool Manager with:
- Connection pool lifecycle management
- Circuit breaker integration
- Health monitoring and metrics
- Error handling with retry logic
- Comprehensive test suite

### Environment

```bash
OpenHands Image: docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/openhands:0.59
Runtime Image: docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.59-nikolaik
LLM Model: openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1:free
Workspace: /tmp/openhands_test
Config Directory: /tmp/openhands_config (chmod 777)
Timeout: 180 seconds
Max Iterations: 10
```

### Docker Command

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --pull=never \
  -e SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE=docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.59-nikolaik \

## Detailed Findings

### Issue 1: Permission Error (RESOLVED)

**Problem:**
```
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/.openhands/sessions/59a3cff9-d81f-46-27d1e77e868d965'
```

**Root Cause:**
- OpenHands tries to write session data to `/.openhands/` directory
- Default volume mount `~/.openhands:/.openhands` has permission issues
- Container runs as user `enduser` (UID 1000) but directory owned by host user

**Solution:**
```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/openhands_config
chmod 777 /tmp/openhands_config
# Use in Docker: -v /tmp/openhands_config:/.openhands
```

**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

### Issue 2: Condensation Loop Bug (BLOCKING)

**Problem:**
Agent gets stuck in infinite condensation loop, never executes the actual task.

**Evidence:**
```
23:52:20 - openhands:WARNING: conversation_window_condenser.py:128 - All recent events are dangling observations, which we truncate. This means the agent has only the essential first events. This should not happen.
23:52:20 - openhands:INFO: conversation_window_condenser.py:152 - ConversationWindowCondenser: Keeping 4 events, forgetting 0 events.
23:52:20 - ACTION
[Agent Controller a6f520c9-d338-4c-0b48abc30e1ed49] CondensationAction(action=<ActionType.CONDENSATION: 'condensation'>, forgotten_event_ids=[], forgotten_events_start_id=None, forgotten_events_end_id=None, summary=None, summary_offset=None)
```

**Pattern:**
1. Agent receives task: "Create a file named hello.txt..."
2. Agent enters RUNNING state
3. Agent immediately starts condensation loop
4. Condensation repeats 5 times (consuming all 10 max iterations)
5. Agent hits max iteration limit and enters ERROR state
6. No actual task execution occurs

**Root Cause:**
- OpenHands conversation window condenser has a bug
- It detects "dangling observations" and tries to condense them
- Condensation action itself creates more dangling observations
- Creates infinite loop until max iterations hit

**Impact:**
- ❌ **CRITICAL** - Agent cannot execute ANY tasks
- Affects all task types (file creation, code generation, etc.)
- Makes OpenHands 0.59 completely non-functional

**Status:** ❌ BLOCKING - Cannot proceed with OpenHands 0.59

---

### Issue 3: No File Generation

**Problem:**
Even after 180 seconds of execution, no files are created in workspace.

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ ls -la /tmp/openhands_test/
total 280
drwxrwxr-x  3 thein root   4096 Oct 27 16:51 .
drwxrwxrwt 49 root  root 274432 Oct 27 16:51 ..
drwxr-xr-x  2 thein root   4096 Oct 27 16:51 .downloads

$ find /tmp/openhands_test -type f -name "*.txt"
(no output)
```

**Root Cause:**
- Agent never executes the task due to condensation loop bug
- No bash commands run, no files created
- Workspace remains empty except for `.downloads` directory

**Status:** ❌ BLOCKED by Issue 2

## Execution Timeline

| Time | Event | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| 23:51:44 | Container Start | OpenHands 0.59 container starts |
| 23:51:45 | Runtime Init | Runtime container starts (30s startup) |
| 23:52:15 | Runtime Ready | Runtime becomes ready |
| 23:52:19 | Task Received | User task: "Create a file named hello.txt..." |

| 23:52:22 | Max Iterations | Agent hits max iteration limit (10) |
| 23:52:22 | Error State | Agent enters ERROR state |
| 23:52:22 | Execution End | No files created, task failed |

**Total Duration:** ~38 seconds (mostly runtime startup)  
**Actual Task Execution:** 0 seconds (stuck in condensation loop)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why OpenHands 0.59 Fails

1. **Conversation Window Condenser Bug**
   - Component: `openhands/controller/conversation_window_condenser.py`
   - Issue: Detects "dangling observations" incorrectly
   - Result: Creates infinite condensation loop

2. **Event Stream Management**
   - Component: `openhands/events/stream.py`
   - Issue: Events not properly linked to actions
   - Result: All observations appear "dangling"

3. **Agent Controller State Machine**
   - Component: `openhands/controller/agent_controller.py`
   - Issue: Doesn't detect condensation loop
   - Result: Consumes all iterations without progress

### Why This Wasn't Caught Earlier

- Previous tests (documented in `OPENHANDS_WORKFLOW_TEST_FINDINGS.md`) showed:
  - Docker containers execute successfully
  - Runtime starts correctly
  - No error messages
  - But no files created

- The condensation loop bug was hidden because:
  - Logs showed "success=True" (container ran)
  - No obvious error messages
  - Minimal output made debugging difficult

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **❌ DO NOT USE OpenHands 0.59 for production**
   - Fundamental bugs prevent task execution
   - Condensation loop makes it completely non-functional
   - No workaround available

2. **✅ Document findings for future reference**
   - This report provides detailed diagnostics
   - Helps evaluate future OpenHands versions
   - Informs decision to use alternative tools

3. **✅ Explore alternatives**
   - Use direct LLM API calls for code generation
   - Consider other code generation tools (Aider, Cursor, etc.)
   - Implement custom code generation pipeline

### For Future OpenHands Versions

1. **Test with newer versions**
   - Try OpenHands 0.60+ when available
   - Check release notes for condensation bug fixes
   - Verify file generation works before integration

2. **Implement robust testing**
   - Test simple file creation first
   - Verify agent actually executes tasks
   - Check for infinite loops and stuck states

3. **Add monitoring**
   - Track agent action types (not just success/fail)
   - Monitor iteration counts
   - Alert on condensation loops

### Alternative Approaches

1. **Direct LLM Code Generation**
   ```python
   # Use OpenRouter API directly
   response = await openrouter_client.chat.completions.create(
       model="deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1:free",
       messages=[{
           "role": "user",
           "content": "Generate Python code for Redis Connection Pool Manager..."
       }]
   )
   code = response.choices[0].message.content
   # Write code to file
   Path("redis_pool_manager.py").write_text(code)
   ```

2. **Template-Based Generation**
   - Use Jinja2 templates for common patterns
   - Fill in specifics with LLM
   - More reliable than full code generation

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Generate code structure with templates
   - Use LLM for complex logic
   - Human review and refinement

   - No workaround available

2. ❌ **File Generation**
   - Zero files created in all tests
   - Agent never executes actual tasks
   - Workspace remains empty

3. ❌ **Error Reporting**
   - "Success=True" despite failure
   - Minimal output hides bugs
   - Difficult to diagnose without direct CLI access

---

## Conclusion

**OpenHands 0.59 is NOT suitable for production use** due to critical bugs:

1. **Condensation Loop Bug** - Agent gets stuck and never executes tasks
2. **No File Generation** - Zero output despite "successful" execution
3. **Poor Error Reporting** - Failures appear as successes

**Recommendation:** Use alternative code generation approaches until OpenHands bugs are fixed.

**TTA Integration Status:**
- ✅ Infrastructure: Complete and validated
- ❌ Functionality: Blocked by OpenHands bugs
- ⏸️ Production Use: Postponed until OpenHands 0.60+ is available
