  --body "## Component Promotion Blocker

**Component**: Carbon
**Blocker Type**: Tests (minimal gap)
**Target Stage**: Staging
**Severity**: Low
**Priority**: **P0 (Quick Win!)**
**Current Coverage**: **69.7%**
**Gap**: **0.3%** (just 1-2 tests needed!)

---

## Blocker Description

Carbon component has **69.7% test coverage**, just **0.3% below** the 70% threshold for staging promotion.

This is the **easiest and fastest win** - add 1-2 simple tests and this component is ready!

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test coverage â‰¥70%
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Coverage verified with: \`uv run pytest tests/test_components.py --cov=src/components/carbon_component.py --cov-report=term\`

---

## Proposed Solution

Add 1-2 simple tests to \`tests/test_components.py\`:

\`\`\`python
def test_carbon_health_check(self):
    \"\"\"Test Carbon component health check.\"\"\"
    config = TTAConfig()
    carbon = CarbonComponent(config)
    carbon.start()

    health = carbon.health_check()
    assert health is not None
    assert \"status\" in health

    carbon.stop()

def test_carbon_error_handling(self):
    \"\"\"Test Carbon component error handling.\"\"\"
    config = TTAConfig()
    carbon = CarbonComponent(config)

    # Test handling of invalid configuration
    # Add appropriate error handling test
\`\`\`

---

## Verification

\`\`\`bash
# Run tests with coverage
uv run pytest tests/test_components.py::TestComponents::test_carbon_component \\
  tests/test_components.py::TestComponents::test_carbon_health_check \\
  tests/test_components.py::TestComponents::test_carbon_error_handling \\
  --cov=src/components/carbon_component.py \\
  --cov-report=term

# Should show â‰¥70% coverage
\`\`\`

## Estimated Effort

**Time**: 0.5 days
**Complexity**: Very Low
**Impact**: HIGH (first component to staging!)

**Component**: Carbon
**Blocker Type**: Code Quality
**Target Stage**: Staging
**Severity**: Medium
**Priority**: **P0**
**Coverage**: 69.7% âœ… (will be â‰¥70% after test blocker resolved)

---

## Blocker Description

Carbon component has:
- **69 linting issues**
- **Type checking errors**

These must be resolved before staging promotion.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All linting issues resolved
- [ ] \`uvx ruff check src/components/carbon_component.py\` passes
- [ ] \`uvx pyright src/components/carbon_component.py\` passes
- [ ] \`uvx bandit -r src/components/carbon_component.py -ll\` passes

---

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Auto-fix Linting

\`\`\`bash
# Auto-fix most issues
uvx ruff check --fix src/components/carbon_component.py

# Check remaining
uvx ruff check src/components/carbon_component.py
\`\`\`

### 2. Fix Type Checking

\`\`\`bash
# Identify type errors
uvx pyright src/components/carbon_component.py

# Fix manually (likely related to CODECARBON_AVAILABLE constant)
\`\`\`

### 3. Verify All Checks

\`\`\`bash
uvx ruff check src/components/carbon_component.py
uvx pyright src/components/carbon_component.py
uvx bandit -r src/components/carbon_component.py -ll
\`\`\`

## Blocker Description

Model Management has **100% test coverage** but needs code quality fixes:
- **665 linting issues** (highest count)
- **Type checking errors**
- **Security issues** (Hugging Face unsafe downloads)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All linting issues resolved
- [ ] \`uvx ruff check src/components/model_management/\` passes
- [ ] \`uvx pyright src/components/model_management/\` passes
- [ ] \`uvx bandit -r src/components/model_management/ -ll\` passes (no security issues)

---

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Fix Security Issues (PRIORITY)

**Issue**: Unsafe Hugging Face downloads without revision pinning

\`\`\`python
# BEFORE (unsafe)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

# AFTER (safe - pin to specific revision)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    revision=\"abc123def456\"  # Specific commit hash
)
\`\`\`

**Files to update**:
- \`src/components/model_management/providers/local.py\`
- Any other files using \`from_pretrained()\`

### 2. Auto-fix Linting

\`\`\`bash
uvx ruff check --fix src/components/model_management/
\`\`\`

### 3. Fix Remaining Issues

\`\`\`bash
uvx ruff check src/components/model_management/
uvx pyright src/components/model_management/

## Estimated Effort

**Time**: 2-3 days
**Complexity**: Medium (security fixes require careful testing)
