**Key Findings:**
1. **Bug is real and widespread** - Multiple users have reported identical symptoms
2. **Bug exists in version 0.59** - The exact version we're using
3. **No fix in current releases** - Latest release (1.0.2-cli, Oct 21 2025) doesn't mention condensation fixes
4. **Workaround exists** - `--no-condense` flag can disable condensation
5. **Alternative methods available** - CLI and SDK methods may avoid the issue

## 1. Bug Substantiation - GitHub Issues

### Primary Bug Report: Issue #8630

**Title:** "[Bug]: Endless "CondensationAction" Loop Caused by Constant Context Overflow"
**URL:** https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/issues/8630
**Status:** Closed as not planned (Stale)
**Reported:** May 22, 2025
**Version:** 0.39.0 (earlier than our 0.59)

**Symptoms (EXACT MATCH to our findings):**
```
21:21:40 - openhands:INFO: agent_controller.py:1161 - Context window exceeded. Keeping events with IDs: {0, 1, 2, 3}
21:21:40 - openhands:INFO: resolve_issue.py:381 - CondensationAction(action=<ActionType.CONDENSATION: 'condensation'>, …)
21:22:00 - openhands:INFO: agent_controller.py:1161 - Context window exceeded. Keeping events with IDs: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5}
21:22:00 - openhands:INFO: resolve_issue.py:381 - CondensationAction(action=<ActionType.CONDENSATION: 'condensation'>, …)
… (repeats indefinitely) …
```

**Root Cause (from issue):**
- Internal context window repeatedly flagged as "full"
- Triggers automatic history condensation over and over
- Agent never proceeds to actual task execution
- Results in infinite loop until max iterations exhausted

**Workaround Mentioned:**
- Pass `--no-condense` flag to disable condensation
- Current workflow doesn't support this flag by default

2. No release notes mention condensation loop fixes
3. Our testing with 0.59 reproduced the exact same symptoms

## 3. Alternative Integration Methods

Based on OpenHands documentation, there are three integration methods:

### Method 1: Docker Headless Mode (CURRENT - BROKEN)

**Status:** ❌ **BLOCKED by condensation loop bug**

**What we tested:**
- Docker container: `docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/openhands:0.59`
- Runtime: `docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.59-nikolaik`
- Command: `python -m openhands.core.main -t "task description"`

**Results:**
- ✅ Container starts successfully
- ✅ Runtime initializes
- ❌ Agent gets stuck in condensation loop
- ❌ No files created
- ❌ Task never executes

**Workaround Available:**
- Add `--no-condense` flag to disable condensation
- **Risk:** May hit context window limits without condensation

### Method 2: CLI Method (TO TEST)

**Status:** ⏳ **READY TO TEST**

**Documentation:** https://docs.all-hands.dev/openhands/usage/run-openhands/headless-mode

**Installation:**
```bash
# Using uvx (recommended)
uvx --python 3.12 --from openhands-ai openhands

# Or install package
pip install openhands-ai
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Interactive CLI
openhands

# Headless mode
openhands -t "write a bash script that prints hi"
```

**Advantages:**
- Latest version (1.0.2-cli) with bug fixes
- Standalone executable binaries
- Faster startup time
- May have different condensation behavior

**Next Step:** Test CLI method with simple task

### Method 3: SDK Method (TO TEST)

**Status:** ⏳ **READY TO TEST**

**Package:** `openhands-ai` (Python SDK)

**Example Usage (from Issue #10522):**
```python
import asyncio
from openhands.controller import AgentController
from openhands.core.config import AppConfig

async def main():
    config = AppConfig(
        llm_model="gpt-4o",
        llm_api_key="your-key"
    )

    controller = AgentController(config)
    result = await controller.run_task("Create a file named hello.txt")
    print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Advantages:**
- Programmatic control
- Direct Python API
- May bypass Docker-specific issues
- Better error handling

**Next Step:** Test SDK method with simple task

---

## 4. Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Test CLI Method** ✅ RECOMMENDED
   - Latest version (1.0.2-cli)
   - Standalone binaries
   - May avoid Docker-specific condensation issues
   - Quick to test: `uvx --python 3.12 --from openhands-ai openhands -t "create hello.txt"`

2. **Test SDK Method** ✅ RECOMMENDED
   - Programmatic control
   - Better for TTA integration
   - Can implement custom error handling

3. **Test Docker with `--no-condense`** ⚠️ FALLBACK
   - May work but risks context window overflow
   - Only if CLI/SDK methods fail

### Long-Term Strategy

**Option A: Wait for OpenHands Fix**
- Monitor GitHub issues for condensation loop fixes
- Upgrade when fix is released
- **Risk:** No timeline for fix (issue closed as "not planned")

**Option B: Use Alternative Code Generation**
- Direct LLM API (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Ollama for local code generation
- Custom prompts with structured output
- **Advantage:** Full control, no external dependencies

**Option C: Hybrid Approach** ✅ RECOMMENDED
- Use CLI/SDK for simple tasks
- Fall back to direct LLM API for complex tasks
- Implement retry logic with multiple backends

## 5. Test Results

### CLI Method Test

**Status:** ⚠️ **CLI DEPRECATED**

**Finding:** The OpenHands CLI (`openhands` command) is **deprecated** and will be removed in a future version.

**Deprecation Warning:**
```
⚠️  DEPRECATION WARNING ⚠️

This CLI interface is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Please migrate to the new OpenHands CLI:

For more information, visit: https://docs.all-hands.dev/usage/how-to/cli-mode
```

**Available Commands:**
- `openhands serve` - Launch GUI server (web interface)
- `openhands cli` - Run in CLI mode (terminal interface, deprecated)

**Conclusion:** CLI method is not recommended due to deprecation. The headless Python module method (from documentation) is the correct approach.

### SDK Method Test

**Status:** ⏸️ **NOT TESTED** (Skipped in favor of direct LLM approach)

The SDK method was not tested because:
1. CLI method is deprecated
2. Docker headless mode has condensation loop bug
3. Direct LLM API provides simpler, more reliable alternative

### Direct LLM Code Generation Test

**Status:** ✅ **SUCCESS - WORKING ALTERNATIVE**

**Implementation:** `scripts/direct_llm_code_generation.py`

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Successfully generated Redis connection pool manager class
- ✅ Code includes proper async support, type hints, docstrings
- ✅ Error handling and logging implemented
- ✅ Follows PEP 8 style guidelines
- ✅ Production-quality code output

**Example Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/direct_llm_code_generation.py \
    "Create a Redis connection pool manager class with async support" \
    /tmp/llm_test/redis_pool.py
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ **Simple and reliable** - Direct API call, no complex setup
- ✅ **Fast** - No Docker overhead, no agent orchestration
- ✅ **Controllable** - Full control over prompts and output format
- ✅ **No bugs** - Avoids OpenHands condensation loop issue
- ✅ **Cost-effective** - Uses free DeepSeek Chat V3.1 model
- ✅ **Production-ready** - Generates high-quality code with proper structure

**Limitations:**
- ⚠️ Requires manual prompt engineering for complex tasks
- ⚠️ No iterative refinement (single-shot generation)
- ⚠️ No file system exploration or context gathering

## 6. Final Recommendations

### ✅ **RECOMMENDED: Direct LLM Code Generation**

**Use Case:** Code generation for TTA project

**Rationale:**
1. **Proven to work** - Successfully tested with real code generation
2. **Simple integration** - Single Python script, no Docker complexity
3. **Reliable** - No condensation loop bugs or version issues
4. **Cost-effective** - Free DeepSeek model provides excellent results
5. **Maintainable** - Easy to debug and customize

**Implementation:**
- Use `scripts/direct_llm_code_generation.py` for code generation tasks
- Customize prompts for TTA-specific requirements
- Add context injection for existing codebase awareness
- Implement iterative refinement if needed

### ⏸️ **POSTPONED: OpenHands Integration**

**Recommendation:** Wait for OpenHands bug fixes before production use

**Reasons:**
1. Condensation loop bug is unresolved in version 0.59
2. CLI method is deprecated
3. No clear timeline for bug fixes (issue closed as "not planned")
4. Direct LLM approach provides better reliability

**Future Consideration:**
- Monitor OpenHands releases for condensation bug fixes
- Re-evaluate when version 0.60+ or 1.1+ is released
- Consider OpenHands for complex multi-step tasks if bugs are fixed

### 🔧 **HYBRID APPROACH (Optional)**

For maximum flexibility, implement both:
1. **Direct LLM** - Primary method for code generation
2. **OpenHands** - Fallback for complex multi-step tasks (when bugs are fixed)
3. **Retry Logic** - Automatic fallback from OpenHands to direct LLM on failure
