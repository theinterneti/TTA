---

### Test 6: Character Creation Submission ‚ùå FAIL (NEW Issue #4)

**Objective:** Submit character creation form and verify character is created

**Steps:**
1. Complete all 3 steps of character creation form
2. Click "Create Character" button

**Results:**
- ‚ùå **Character creation FAILS**
- ‚ùå Error message: "Player ID not found. Please log in again."
- ‚ùå Character NOT created
- ‚ùå Character does NOT appear in character list

**Root Cause:**
The backend API is unable to retrieve the player_id from the JWT token or session. This suggests:
1. JWT token may not contain player_id claim
2. Backend authentication middleware not extracting player_id correctly
3. Session management issue between frontend and backend

**Evidence:**
- Error message visible in UI: "Player ID not found. Please log in again."
- Character count remains 0

**Verdict:** ‚ùå FAIL - **NEW CRITICAL ISSUE #4 DISCOVERED**

---

## Console Error Analysis

### Session Restoration Errors (Issue #2 NOT FIXED)

**Observed Errors:**
```
[ERROR] Failed to retrieve session data: RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
[ERROR] Failed to retrieve session data: RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
[ERROR] Failed to retrieve session data: RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
...
```

**Frequency:** Multiple errors per page navigation (5-10 errors)

**Impact:**
- Performance degradation
- Potential browser crash with extended use
- Poor user experience

**Root Cause:**
Frontend container is running **old build** without session restoration fixes. Despite rebuilding twice:
1. First rebuild: `docker-compose build --no-cache`
2. Second rebuild: Complete removal of container and image + rebuild

The frontend is still using cached or old code.

**Verdict:** ‚ùå Issue #2 NOT FIXED - Frontend deployment issue

---

### WebSocket Connection (Issue #3 Status Unclear)

**Expected Behavior:**
- Console should show: "WebSocket connecting to: ws://localhost:8081/ws/chat"
- Debug logging from WebSocket fixes should be visible

**Observed Behavior:**
- **NO WebSocket errors** in console (previously showed "WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:3000/ws' failed")
- **NO debug logging** from WebSocket fixes
- WebSocket connection status unclear

**Analysis:**
The absence of WebSocket errors could mean:
1. WebSocket connection is working correctly (Issue #3 resolved)
2. WebSocket connection not being attempted (no chat/gameplay initiated)
3. Frontend using old build, so fixes not applied but also not triggering errors

**Verdict:** ‚ö†Ô∏è UNKNOWN - Cannot confirm fix status without initiating chat/gameplay

---

## Critical Issues Summary

### Issue #1: Character Creation Form Unavailable ‚úÖ RESOLVED

**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Root Cause:** Database not initialized
**Fix Applied:** PostgreSQL volume recreated, init script executed, demo_user created
**Verification:** Form opens successfully without errors

---

### Issue #2: Session Restoration Infinite Loop ‚ùå NOT FIXED

**Status:** ‚ùå NOT FIXED
**Root Cause:** Frontend running old build without fixes
**Code Fix Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented (retry limits + concurrent prevention)
**Deployment Status:** ‚ùå NOT DEPLOYED
**Evidence:** Multiple "RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded" errors in console

**Required Action:**
Investigate why frontend container is using old build despite:
- Two complete rebuilds with `--no-cache`
- Complete removal of container and image
- Verification that new image was created

Possible causes:
1. Docker volume mount caching build artifacts
2. Browser caching old JavaScript bundles
3. Nginx/serve caching old static files
4. Build process not copying updated source files into image

---

### Issue #3: WebSocket Connection Failure ‚ö†Ô∏è STATUS UNCLEAR

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è UNKNOWN
**Code Fix Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented (fallback + debug logging)
**Deployment Status:** ‚ùå NOT DEPLOYED (same frontend build issue)
**Evidence:** No WebSocket errors, but no debug logging either

**Required Action:**
1. Fix frontend deployment issue (same as Issue #2)
2. Initiate chat/gameplay to trigger WebSocket connection
3. Verify debug logging appears in console
4. Confirm connection to `ws://localhost:8081/ws/chat`

---

### Issue #4: Player ID Authentication ‚ùå NEW CRITICAL ISSUE

**Status:** ‚ùå NEW CRITICAL ISSUE
**Severity:** P0 - CRITICAL (blocks character creation)
**Error:** "Player ID not found. Please log in again."
**Impact:** Cannot create characters, core functionality broken

**Root Cause Analysis:**
The backend API cannot retrieve player_id from the authenticated user. Possible causes:

1. **JWT Token Missing player_id Claim:**
   - Login endpoint may not include player_id in JWT payload
   - Token structure may be incorrect

2. **Backend Middleware Issue:**
   - Authentication middleware not extracting player_id from token
   - player_id not being added to request context

3. **Database Schema Mismatch:**
   - users table may not have player_id column
   - player_id may be in different table (tta_player.profiles)

4. **Session Management Issue:**
   - Frontend not sending JWT token with character creation request
   - Backend not validating token correctly

**Required Investigation:**
```bash
# Check JWT token structure
# Decode token from browser localStorage/cookies

# Check users table schema
docker exec -it tta-staging-postgres psql -U tta_staging_user -d tta_staging -c "\d tta_core.users"

# Check if player_id exists for demo_user
docker exec -it tta-staging-postgres psql -U tta_staging_user -d tta_staging -c "SELECT id, username, email FROM tta_core.users WHERE username='demo_user';"

# Check backend logs for authentication errors
docker logs tta-staging-player-api --tail 100 | grep -i "player\|auth\|token"
```

**Verdict:** ‚ùå CRITICAL - Blocks all character creation functionality

## Test Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Tests** | 6 |
| **Passed** | 4 |

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (P0 - Critical)

1. **Investigate Player ID Authentication Issue (Issue #4)**
   - Check JWT token structure and claims
   - Verify backend authentication middleware
   - Check database schema for player_id
   - Review character creation API endpoint

2. **Fix Frontend Deployment Issue (Issues #2 & #3)**
   - Investigate Docker build/deployment process
   - Check for volume mounts caching build artifacts
   - Verify source code is being copied into Docker image
   - Consider alternative deployment approach (direct npm build)

### Next Steps

1. **Resolve Issue #4** (Player ID Authentication)
2. **Resolve Frontend Deployment** (Issues #2 & #3)
3. **Re-test Character Creation** end-to-end
4. **Verify WebSocket Connection** (initiate chat/gameplay)
5. **Run Phase 2 E2E Tests** once all issues resolved

## Conclusion

**Phase 1 Manual Testing Status:** üî¥ **PARTIAL SUCCESS**

**Achievements:**
- ‚úÖ Database initialization successful
- ‚úÖ Authentication working
- ‚úÖ Issue #1 (Character Creation Form Access) RESOLVED
- ‚úÖ Form UI/UX functional

**Blockers:**
- ‚ùå Issue #2 (Session Restoration) NOT FIXED - Frontend deployment issue
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue #3 (WebSocket) STATUS UNCLEAR - Frontend deployment issue
- ‚ùå Issue #4 (Player ID Authentication) NEW CRITICAL ISSUE - Blocks character creation

**Overall Assessment:**
While significant progress was made (database initialized, login working, form accessible), **critical blockers remain** that prevent full end-to-end character creation. The staging environment is **NOT READY** for UAT (Phase 3) until Issues #2, #3, and #4 are resolved.

**Estimated Time to Resolve:** 2-4 hours
- Issue #4 investigation: 1-2 hours
- Frontend deployment fix: 30-60 minutes
- Re-testing: 30-60 minutes
