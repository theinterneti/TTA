## ‚ùå Critical Blockers

### Issue #2: Session Restoration Infinite Loop ‚ùå NOT FIXED

**Status:** ‚ùå NOT FIXED
**Severity:** P1 - HIGH (degrades performance, poor UX)
**Root Cause:** Frontend container running old build without fixes

**Evidence:**
```
Console Errors (repeated 5-10 times per page navigation):
[ERROR] Failed to retrieve session data: RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
```

**Code Fix Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented
**Deployment Status:** ‚ùå NOT DEPLOYED

**Investigation Findings:**
Despite TWO complete frontend rebuilds:
1. First rebuild: `docker-compose build --no-cache player-frontend-staging`
2. Second rebuild: Complete removal of container + image + rebuild

The frontend container is STILL running old code. Possible causes:
1. Docker volume mount caching build artifacts
2. Browser caching old JavaScript bundles
3. Nginx/serve caching old static files
4. Build process not copying updated source files into Docker image
5. React development server using cached bundles

**Required Action:**
1. Investigate Docker build process and volume mounts
2. Check Dockerfile for proper COPY commands
3. Verify build artifacts are being generated correctly
4. Consider alternative deployment (direct npm build without Docker)
5. Clear browser cache and test again

### Issue #3: WebSocket Connection ‚ö†Ô∏è STATUS UNCLEAR

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è UNKNOWN
**Severity:** P1 - HIGH (blocks real-time chat/gameplay)
**Root Cause:** Same frontend deployment issue as Issue #2

**Evidence:**
- **NO WebSocket errors** in console (previously showed "WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:3000/ws' failed")
- **NO debug logging** from WebSocket fixes
- Cannot confirm if connection works without initiating chat/gameplay

**Code Fix Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented
**Deployment Status:** ‚ùå NOT DEPLOYED

**Analysis:**
The absence of WebSocket errors could mean:
1. WebSocket connection working correctly (Issue #3 resolved)
2. WebSocket not being attempted (no chat/gameplay initiated)
3. Frontend using old build, so fixes not applied

**Required Action:**
1. Fix frontend deployment issue (same as Issue #2)
2. Initiate chat/gameplay to trigger WebSocket connection
3. Verify debug logging appears: "WebSocket connecting to: ws://localhost:8081/ws/chat"
4. Confirm connection successful

### Issue #4: Player ID Authentication ‚ùå NEW CRITICAL ISSUE

**Status:** ‚ùå NEW CRITICAL ISSUE
**Severity:** P0 - CRITICAL (blocks character creation)
**Error:** "Player ID not found. Please log in again."

**Root Cause Analysis:**

The backend API is looking for `player_id`, but the database schema uses different terminology:

**Database Schema:**
- `tta_core.users.id` = User ID (UUID)
- `tta_player.profiles.id` = Profile ID (UUID)
- `tta_player.profiles.user_id` = Foreign key to users.id
- **NO `player_id` column exists**

**Backend Expectation:**
- Character creation endpoint expects `player_id` from JWT token or session
- `player_id` should reference the player's profile ID

**The Problem:**
1. JWT token likely contains `user_id` (from tta_core.users.id), not `player_id`
2. Backend is looking for `player_id` which doesn't exist
3. User may not have a profile created yet in `tta_player.profiles`

**Solution Options:**

**Option 1: Create Profile on Login (Recommended)**
```python
# In login endpoint, after user authentication:
# 1. Check if profile exists for user
profile = db.query(Profile).filter(Profile.user_id == user.id).first()

# 2. If no profile, create one
if not profile:
    profile = Profile(
        user_id=user.id,
        display_name=user.username,
        preferences={},
        statistics={}
    )
    db.add(profile)
    db.commit()

# 3. Include profile.id as player_id in JWT token
token_data = {
    "sub": user.id,  # user_id
    "player_id": profile.id,  # profile_id
    "username": user.username
}
```

**Option 2: Use user_id Instead of player_id**
```python
# In character creation endpoint:
# Change from:
player_id = get_current_player_id()  # Expects player_id

# To:
user_id = get_current_user_id()  # Use user_id
profile = db.query(Profile).filter(Profile.user_id == user_id).first()
if not profile:
    # Create profile if doesn't exist
    profile = create_profile_for_user(user_id)
player_id = profile.id
```

**Option 3: Auto-create Profile in Character Creation**
```python
# In character creation endpoint:
user_id = get_current_user_id()
profile = get_or_create_profile(user_id)
character = Character(
    profile_id=profile.id,
    name=character_data.name,
    ...
)
```

**Recommended Approach:** Option 1 (Create Profile on Login)
- Ensures profile exists before any player actions
- Simplifies downstream logic
- Matches expected data model

**Required Changes:**
1. Update login endpoint to create profile if doesn't exist
2. Include `player_id` (profile.id) in JWT token payload
3. Update authentication middleware to extract `player_id` from token
4. Verify character creation endpoint uses `player_id` correctly

## üí° Key Learnings

1. **Database Initialization:** PostgreSQL only runs init scripts on first startup with empty data directory. Recreating the volume forces re-initialization.

2. **Docker Image Caching:** Simply rebuilding with `--no-cache` may not be enough. Complete removal of container + image is sometimes necessary, but even that may not work if volume mounts are caching build artifacts.

3. **Frontend Build Deployment:** Docker-based frontend deployments can have complex caching issues. Consider alternative approaches (direct npm build, different base images, etc).

4. **Database Schema Terminology:** Backend code must match database schema terminology exactly. Mismatches like `player_id` vs `user_id` vs `profile.id` cause critical failures.

5. **Profile Creation Timing:** User profiles should be created at login time, not lazily during first use, to avoid downstream authentication issues.

6. **Comprehensive Testing Value:** Manual testing uncovered a critical issue (Issue #4) that would have blocked all character creation in production.
