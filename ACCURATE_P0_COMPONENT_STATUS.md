- **Blockers**: 59 linting + 74 type errors
- **Confidence**: HIGH (has README)

### Priority 3: Gameplay Loop
- **Effort**: 6-7 hours
- **Blockers**: 108 linting + 356 type errors + README
- **Confidence**: MEDIUM (high type error count)

## Updated Timeline

### Week 1: P0 Components (4 total)

| Day | Component | Effort | Status |
|-----|-----------|--------|--------|
| **1** | **Carbon** | 2 hours | ✅ **COMPLETE** |
| **2** | **Narrative Coherence** | 2 hours | ⏳ **NEXT** |
| **3** | **Model Management** | 2.75 hours | Pending |
| **4-5** | **Gameplay Loop** | 6-7 hours | Pending |

**Total Week 1**: 12.75-13.75 hours of work
**Feasibility**: ✅ ACHIEVABLE (2-3 hours/day over 5 days)

## Comparison with Original "Corrected" Analysis

### What Changed ✅

| Component | Original Linting | Actual Linting | Original Type Errors | Actual Type Errors |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Narrative Coherence | 433 | **40** | "Yes" | **20** |
| Model Management | 665 | **59** | "Yes" | **74** |
| Gameplay Loop | 1,247 | **108** | "Yes" | **356** |

**Key Finding**: Original analysis was counting linting errors across ENTIRE codebase, not per-component.

### Impact on Timeline ✅

**Original Estimate**: 11-12 weeks (based on inflated linting counts)
**Corrected Estimate**: 7-8 weeks (based on accurate counts)
**Re-Verified Estimate**: **7-8 weeks** ✅ CONFIRMED

**Confidence**: HIGH - actual work is significantly less than originally thought.

## Action Plan for Narrative Coherence (Next 2 Hours)

### Step 1: Fix Linting (30 min)
```bash
# Auto-fix what we can
uvx ruff check --fix src/components/narrative_coherence/

# Check remaining
uvx ruff check src/components/narrative_coherence/

# Manual fixes for remaining issues
```

### Step 2: Fix Type Errors (1 hour)
```bash
# Identify type errors
uvx pyright src/components/narrative_coherence/ > type_errors.txt

# Fix systematically
# - Unused arguments: prefix with _
# - Missing type hints: add them
# - Type mismatches: correct them
```

### Step 3: Create README (30 min)
```bash
# Create comprehensive README
# - Component overview
# - Key features
# - Usage examples
# - API documentation
# - Configuration options
```

### Step 4: Verify & Promote (10 min)
```bash
# Run all checks
uvx ruff check src/components/narrative_coherence/
uvx pyright src/components/narrative_coherence/
uvx bandit -r src/components/narrative_coherence/ -ll
uv run pytest tests/test_narrative_coherence_engine.py --cov=src/components/narrative_coherence

# Create promotion request
gh issue create --title "[PROMOTION] Narrative Coherence: Development → Staging" ...
```
