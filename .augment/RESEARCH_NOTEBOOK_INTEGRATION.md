# Research Notebook Integration

## Overview

The TTA Research Notebook (NotebookLM) has been integrated into the development workflow to provide AI-driven guidance during implementation. The notebook contains research on:

- **AI-Native Development Framework** (3 layers: Prompt Engineering, Agent Primitives, Context Engineering)
- **Agent Orchestration Patterns**
- **MCP Tool Integration and Security**
- **Context Engineering Best Practices**
- **Agent Package Management (APM)**
- **Agent CLI Runtime Patterns**

## Quick Access

### Command Line Query
```bash
uv run python scripts/query_notebook_helper.py "Your question here"
```

### Python API
```python
from scripts.query_notebook_helper import query_notebook

# In async context
response = await query_notebook("What are MCP security best practices?")
```

## Integrated Chatmodes

The following chatmodes have been enhanced with research notebook access:

### 1. **Architect** (`architect.chatmode.md`)
**Focus:** Framework patterns, agent architecture, context engineering
**Use cases:**
- Designing agent primitive interfaces
- Planning MCP tool integrations
- Making context engineering decisions
- Establishing AI component architectural patterns

**Example queries:**
- "How should I design agent primitive interfaces?"
- "What are MCP security best practices?"
- "What context engineering patterns should I follow?"

### 2. **DevOps** (`devops.chatmode.md`)
**Focus:** Agent CLI runtimes, APM, CI/CD integration
**Use cases:**
- Setting up agent automation in pipelines
- Deploying agent primitives across environments
- Configuring MCP tools for deployment
- Establishing reproducible agent execution

**Example queries:**
- "How should Agent CLI runtimes integrate with CI/CD?"
- "What are best practices for deploying agent primitives?"
- "How should the Agent Package Manager work in production?"

### 3. **Backend Developer** (`backend-dev.chatmode.md`)
**Focus:** Agent primitive implementation, prompt engineering patterns
**Use cases:**
- Implementing chatmodes, workflows, instructions, specs
- Designing AI-friendly interfaces
- Structuring prompt engineering in code
- Implementing MCP tools

**Example queries:**
- "How should I implement a new chatmode?"
- "What context should I include in instruction files?"
- "What are best practices for MCP tool implementation?"

### 4. **QA Engineer** (`qa-engineer.chatmode.md`)
**Focus:** Validation gates, agent testing, MCP security testing
**Use cases:**
- Testing agent primitive workflows
- Validating MCP tool boundaries
- Testing AI component reliability
- Establishing quality gates for AI features

**Example queries:**
- "How should I test agent primitive workflows?"
- "What validation gates should agentic workflows include?"
- "How do I test MCP tool security boundaries?"

## Usage Patterns

### During Architecture Design
```bash
# Consult before designing new agent primitives
uv run python scripts/query_notebook_helper.py \
  "What are the key components of an effective chatmode?"
```

### During Implementation
```python
# Query from within code/scripts if needed
from scripts.query_notebook_helper import query_notebook

async def design_new_primitive():
    guidance = await query_notebook(
        "What Markdown patterns work best for prompt engineering?"
    )
    # Use guidance to inform implementation
```

### During Code Review
```bash
# Validate against research best practices
uv run python scripts/query_notebook_helper.py \
  "Does this MCP tool implementation follow security best practices?"
```

### In CI/CD Pipelines
```yaml
# Could be integrated into quality gates
- name: Validate Architecture
  run: |
    uv run python scripts/query_notebook_helper.py \
      "Does our agent orchestration follow the three-layer framework?" \
      | tee architecture-validation.txt
```

## Configuration

The notebook connection is configured in:
- **Config File:** `notebooklm-config.json`
- **Helper Script:** `scripts/query_notebook_helper.py`
- **Notebook ID:** `d998992e-acd6-4151-a5f2-615ac1f242f3`

### Changing Notebooks
To query a different notebook, update `notebooklm-config.json`:
```json
{
  "default_notebook_id": "your-new-notebook-id-here"
}
```

## Authentication

Authentication is handled automatically using the persistent Chrome profile:
- **Profile Location:** `./chrome_profile_notebooklm/`
- **Initial Setup:** Run `./setup-notebooklm-auth.sh` (one-time)
- **Subsequent Uses:** Authentication persists across sessions

## Best Practices

### When to Query the Notebook

✅ **Do query:**
- Before designing new architectural patterns
- When implementing agent primitives
- For validation of MCP tool security
- When establishing context engineering patterns
- During code reviews for AI components

❌ **Don't query:**
- For basic Python syntax questions
- For standard library documentation (use official docs)
- For project-specific implementation details (use codebase search)
- For real-time debugging (too slow)

### Query Formulation Tips

**Good queries:**
- "What are the three layers of the AI-Native framework?"
- "How should chatmode files be structured?"
- "What MCP security boundaries should I enforce?"
- "What context engineering patterns work best for agent orchestration?"

**Poor queries:**
- "Fix my code" (too vague)
- "What's wrong?" (no context)
- "Help" (not specific)

### Integration with Existing Workflow

1. **Planning Phase:** Query notebook for architectural guidance
2. **Implementation Phase:** Reference query results in code comments
3. **Review Phase:** Validate implementation against research patterns
4. **Documentation Phase:** Link to relevant research findings

## Maintenance

### Updating Research Content
When the NotebookLM notebook is updated with new research:
1. No code changes needed (queries pull latest content)
2. Consider reviewing chatmode integration sections
3. Update example queries if new topics are added

### Troubleshooting
If queries fail:
```bash
# Test connection
uv run python scripts/query_notebook_helper.py "test connection"

# Re-authenticate if needed
./setup-notebooklm-auth.sh

# Check configuration
cat notebooklm-config.json
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Cache frequent queries to reduce latency
- [ ] Add query result logging for reference
- [ ] Integrate into pre-commit hooks for validation
- [ ] Create automated architecture compliance checks
- [ ] Build a query result knowledge base
- [ ] Add query templates for common scenarios
