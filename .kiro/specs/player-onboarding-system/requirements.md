# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Player Onboarding System creates the first impression and initial journey for new TTA users, guiding them from curiosity to confident participation in immersive text adventures. This system focuses specifically on the critical first-time user experience, ensuring users understand TTA as an engaging adventure platform while feeling welcomed, oriented, and excited to begin their journey.

The system must prioritize the adventure experience above all else, introducing users to rich worlds, compelling characters, and meaningful choices.
