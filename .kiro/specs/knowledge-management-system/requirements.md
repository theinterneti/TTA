# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Knowledge Management System is a core infrastructure component that provides unified knowledge storage, retrieval, and evolution capabilities for the TTA platform. This system combines Neo4j knowledge graphs with vector databases to enable semantic search, cross-session knowledge persistence, and intelligent knowledge graph maintenance. The system serves as the foundational layer for therapeutic content delivery, user progress tracking, and narrative coherence across sessions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a therapeutic AI system, I want to store and retrieve structured knowledge relationships, so that I can maintain narrative coherence and therapeutic context across user sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives therapeutic content or user interaction data THEN the system SHALL store structured relationships in the Neo4j knowledge graph
2. WHEN querying for related therapeutic concepts THEN the system SHALL return relevant knowledge nodes with relationship context within 500ms
3. WHEN a user session ends THEN the system SHALL persist all session knowledge updates to the knowledge graph
4. IF knowledge conflicts arise during updates THEN the system SHALL apply conflict resolution rules and maintain data integrity

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a therapeutic content system, I want to perform semantic search across knowledge content, so that I can find contextually relevant therapeutic materials and responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing semantic search queries THEN the system SHALL use vector embeddings to find semantically similar content
2. WHEN integrating vector search with graph relationships THEN the system SHALL combine semantic similarity with structural knowledge relationships
3. WHEN returning search results THEN the system SHALL rank results by both semantic relevance and therapeutic appropriateness
4. IF search queries contain therapeutic keywords THEN the system SHALL prioritize clinically validated content in results

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a unified knowledge manager interface, so that I can manage knowledge operations across different storage backends consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing knowledge operations THEN the system SHALL provide a single interface for both graph and vector operations
2. WHEN performing CRUD operations THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency between Neo4j and vector database states
3. WHEN system components request knowledge services THEN the system SHALL route requests to appropriate storage backends transparently
4. IF backend services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide graceful degradation and error handling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a therapeutic system, I want knowledge to persist and evolve across user sessions, so that therapeutic progress and narrative continuity are maintained over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user returns to the system THEN the system SHALL retrieve their complete knowledge context from previous sessions
2. WHEN new therapeutic insights are generated THEN the system SHALL update the knowledge graph while preserving historical context
3. WHEN knowledge relationships change THEN the system SHALL maintain audit trails for therapeutic accountability
4. IF knowledge evolution affects multiple users THEN the system SHALL apply updates while respecting individual privacy boundaries

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want automated knowledge graph maintenance capabilities, so that the knowledge base remains accurate and optimized over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN knowledge graph grows beyond optimal size THEN the system SHALL perform automated cleanup of obsolete relationships
2. WHEN duplicate or conflicting knowledge entries are detected THEN the system SHALL merge or resolve conflicts automatically
3. WHEN knowledge quality metrics fall below thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger maintenance workflows
4. IF maintenance operations affect active sessions THEN the system SHALL coordinate updates without disrupting user experience

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a therapeutic AI component, I want to access knowledge through standardized schemas and operations, so that I can integrate knowledge services reliably across different system components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components request knowledge operations THEN the system SHALL provide consistent API interfaces regardless of underlying storage
2. WHEN knowledge schemas are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility for existing components
3. WHEN performing bulk knowledge operations THEN the system SHALL support batch processing for performance optimization
4. IF knowledge operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and recovery suggestions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious system, I want knowledge management to respect user privacy and data protection requirements, so that therapeutic data remains secure and compliant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing user-related knowledge THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate privacy controls and access restrictions
2. WHEN knowledge contains sensitive therapeutic information THEN the system SHALL encrypt data at rest and in transit
3. WHEN users request data deletion THEN the system SHALL remove all related knowledge while maintaining system integrity
4. IF privacy violations are detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and prevent unauthorized access
