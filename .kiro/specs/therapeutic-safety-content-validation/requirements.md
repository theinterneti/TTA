# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Therapeutic Safety & Content Validation system is a critical safety layer for the TTA (Therapeutic Text Adventure) platform that ensures all AI-generated content meets therapeutic appropriateness standards, protects user wellbeing, and maintains ethical AI practices. This system validates content before delivery to users, implements crisis intervention protocols, monitors for bias and harmful content, and provides comprehensive privacy protection mechanisms.

Building upon TTA's commitment to therapeutic effectiveness and user safety, this system serves as the guardian layer that ensures every interaction supports user wellbeing while maintaining engaging narrative experiences. The system must operate in real-time, integrate seamlessly with all content generation components, and provide robust safeguards against potential therapeutic harm.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user input indicates crisis or self-harm risk THEN the system SHALL immediately activate crisis intervention protocols
2. WHEN crisis is detected THEN the system SHALL provide immediate access to crisis resources and professional support contacts
3. WHEN emergency protocols are activated THEN the system SHALL notify designated emergency contacts or services as configured
4. IF crisis indicators persist THEN the system SHALL escalate to human intervention and suspend normal therapeutic activities
5. WHEN crisis intervention is complete THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate follow-up support and monitoring

### Requirement 3: Bias Detection and Mitigation

**User Story:** As a user from any background, I want the AI system to treat me fairly and without bias, so that I can receive equitable therapeutic support regardless of my identity or characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL scan for bias related to race, gender, sexuality, religion, disability, and other protected characteristics
2. WHEN bias is detected THEN the system SHALL flag the content and request bias-free alternative generation
3. WHEN bias patterns are identified THEN the system SHALL log incidents and provide feedback for model improvement
4. IF systematic bias is detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and implement corrective measures
5. WHEN bias mitigation is applied THEN the system SHALL validate that corrected content maintains therapeutic effectiveness

### Requirement 4: Therapeutic Appropriateness Validation

**User Story:** As a therapist or clinical supervisor, I want all therapeutic content to align with established therapeutic frameworks and best practices, so that users receive clinically appropriate support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN therapeutic interventions are suggested THEN the system SHALL validate they align with evidence-based therapeutic approaches
2. WHEN emotional content is generated THEN the system SHALL ensure it matches the user's current therapeutic readiness and goals
3. WHEN challenging therapeutic material is presented THEN the system SHALL verify it's appropriate for the user's progress level
4. IF therapeutic content conflicts with clinical guidelines THEN the system SHALL block it and suggest clinically appropriate alternatives
5. WHEN therapeutic milestones are addressed THEN the system SHALL ensure content supports genuine therapeutic progress

### Requirement 5: Privacy Protection and Data Security

**User Story:** As a user, I want my personal information and therapeutic data to be completely protected and secure, so that I can engage openly without fear of privacy violations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user data is processed THEN the system SHALL implement end-to-end encryption for all sensitive therapeutic information
2. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL use secure, HIPAA-compliant storage mechanisms with access controls
3. WHEN data is shared between components THEN the system SHALL anonymize or pseudonymize personal identifiers
4. IF data breaches are detected THEN the system SHALL immediately implement containment measures and notify affected users
5. WHEN users request data deletion THEN the system SHALL securely remove all personal data while preserving anonymized research insights

### Requirement 6: Content Filtering and Age Appropriateness

**User Story:** As a user or parent, I want content to be appropriate for the intended age group and personal boundaries, so that the therapeutic experience remains safe and suitable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL filter it based on user age, maturity level, and configured content preferences
2. WHEN adult themes are detected THEN the system SHALL block them for underage users and provide age-appropriate alternatives
3. WHEN users set content boundaries THEN the system SHALL respect those boundaries and avoid triggering topics
4. IF inappropriate content bypasses filters THEN the system SHALL learn from the incident and improve filtering accuracy
5. WHEN content preferences change THEN the system SHALL immediately apply new filtering rules to all future content

### Requirement 7: Audit Trail and Compliance Monitoring

**User Story:** As a compliance officer or administrator, I want comprehensive audit trails of all safety decisions and interventions, so that I can ensure regulatory compliance and system accountability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN safety validations occur THEN the system SHALL create detailed audit logs with timestamps, decisions, and rationales
2. WHEN interventions are triggered THEN the system SHALL document the intervention type, user impact, and resolution
3. WHEN compliance reports are requested THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive reports on safety metrics and incidents
4. IF regulatory requirements change THEN the system SHALL adapt logging and reporting to meet new compliance standards
5. WHEN audit trails are accessed THEN the system SHALL maintain strict access controls and log all audit access attempts

### Requirement 8: Performance and Scalability Under Safety Constraints

**User Story:** As a user, I want safety validation to happen quickly without disrupting my therapeutic experience, so that I can maintain engagement while staying protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users interact simultaneously THEN the system SHALL maintain safety validation performance without degradation
2. WHEN safety validation load increases THEN the system SHALL scale resources automatically to maintain response times
3. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL prioritize safety validation over other non-critical functions
4. IF safety validation becomes a bottleneck THEN the system SHALL implement optimization strategies while maintaining safety standards
5. WHEN performance metrics are monitored THEN the system SHALL maintain 99.9% uptime for safety validation services

### Requirement 9: Integration with Therapeutic Monitoring
