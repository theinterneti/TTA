# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The TTA Prototype Core Features specification defines the essential narrative and therapeutic components that form the foundation of the Therapeutic Text Adventure platform. This includes the interactive storytelling engine, character system, therapeutic content delivery mechanisms, and narrative progression tracking that enable AI-powered therapeutic interventions through engaging text-based adventures.

This specification focuses on creating a safe, ethical, and therapeutically effective platform that combines engaging storytelling with evidence-based therapeutic techniques. All features must prioritize user safety, privacy, and therapeutic benefit while maintaining narrative immersion and engagement.
