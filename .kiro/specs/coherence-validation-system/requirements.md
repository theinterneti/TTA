# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Coherence Validation System is a critical component of the TTA (Therapeutic Text Adventure) platform that ensures narrative consistency, logical flow, and therapeutic appropriateness across all generated content. This system validates that story elements, character behaviors, world states, and therapeutic interventions maintain coherence throughout the user's journey, preventing contradictions that could break immersion or compromise therapeutic effectiveness.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Narrative Consistency Validation

**User Story:** As a therapeutic content creator, I want the system to automatically validate narrative consistency, so that story elements remain logically coherent throughout the user's experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new narrative event is generated THEN the system SHALL validate it against existing story context for logical consistency
2. WHEN character actions are proposed THEN the system SHALL verify they align with established character traits and previous behaviors
3. WHEN world state changes occur THEN the system SHALL ensure they follow established rules and don't contradict previous states
4. IF narrative inconsistencies are detected THEN the system SHALL provide detailed feedback about the specific conflicts
5. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL return a confidence score indicating the level of coherence

### Requirement 2: Character Behavior Coherence

**User Story:** As a user engaging with therapeutic content, I want characters to behave consistently with their established personalities, so that I can build meaningful therapeutic relationships.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a character performs an action THEN the system SHALL validate it against their personality profile and history
2. WHEN character dialogue is generated THEN the system SHALL ensure it matches their established voice and therapeutic role
3. WHEN character relationships evolve THEN the system SHALL verify changes are gradual and psychologically realistic
4. IF character behavior contradicts established patterns THEN the system SHALL flag the inconsistency with specific details
5. WHEN character development occurs THEN the system SHALL validate that growth follows therapeutic principles

### Requirement 3: Therapeutic Content Validation

**User Story:** As a therapist using the platform, I want all content to be validated for therapeutic appropriateness, so that users receive consistent and beneficial therapeutic experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN therapeutic interventions are suggested THEN the system SHALL validate they align with established therapeutic frameworks
2. WHEN emotional content is generated THEN the system SHALL ensure it's appropriate for the user's current therapeutic stage
3. WHEN challenging scenarios are presented THEN the system SHALL verify they match the user's readiness level
4. IF potentially harmful content is detected THEN the system SHALL block it and suggest alternatives
5. WHEN therapeutic progress is tracked THEN the system SHALL validate that narrative elements support the user's goals

### Requirement 4: World State Coherence

**User Story:** As a user exploring the therapeutic world, I want the environment to remain logically consistent, so that I can maintain immersion and focus on therapeutic work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN locations are described THEN the system SHALL ensure they match previous descriptions and established geography
2. WHEN time passes in the narrative THEN the system SHALL validate that all time-dependent elements update appropriately
3. WHEN objects or items are referenced THEN the system SHALL verify their current state and location are consistent
4. IF world state conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL provide specific details about the inconsistencies
5. WHEN environmental changes occur THEN the system SHALL ensure they follow established physical and narrative rules

### Requirement 5: Cross-Session Coherence

**User Story:** As a user returning to the platform, I want my previous experiences to be remembered and maintained consistently, so that my therapeutic journey feels continuous and meaningful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user returns to a session THEN the system SHALL validate that all persistent elements remain consistent
2. WHEN referencing past events THEN the system SHALL ensure they are accurately represented and haven't been contradicted
3. WHEN character relationships are restored THEN the system SHALL verify they reflect the actual history of interactions
4. IF cross-session inconsistencies are found THEN the system SHALL attempt to resolve them or flag for manual review
5. WHEN therapeutic progress is resumed THEN the system SHALL validate that the narrative context supports continued growth

### Requirement 6: Real-time Validation Performance

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the system, I want validation to happen quickly without interrupting my experience, so that I can maintain engagement with the therapeutic content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation is performed THEN the system SHALL complete checks within 500 milliseconds for standard content
2. WHEN complex validation is required THEN the system SHALL provide progressive feedback rather than blocking
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback to content generators
4. IF validation takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL log performance metrics for optimization
5. WHEN multiple validations run concurrently THEN the system SHALL manage resources efficiently

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Test Coverage

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the coherence validation system, I want comprehensive unit tests that cover all validation scenarios, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are executed THEN they SHALL achieve at least 95% code coverage for all validation components
2. WHEN edge cases are identified THEN they SHALL be covered by specific test cases with clear assertions
3. WHEN validation rules change THEN existing tests SHALL be updated and new tests SHALL be added
4. IF tests fail THEN they SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages indicating what validation failed
5. WHEN performance requirements are tested THEN tests SHALL verify response times meet the 500ms requirement
