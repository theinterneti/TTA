# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Narrative Arc Orchestration system is a comprehensive storytelling management framework that coordinates and maintains narrative coherence across multiple temporal scales within the TTA platform. This system manages short-term interactions, medium-term character development, long-term story arcs, and epic multi-generational narratives while ensuring therapeutic integration and player agency remain central to the experience.

Building upon the existing living worlds infrastructure and therapeutic framework, this system serves as the narrative conductor that weaves together player choices, character development, world events, and therapeutic interventions into cohesive, meaningful stories that adapt and evolve over time. The system draws from the established TTA reference materials while implementing a modern, AI-driven approach to dynamic storytelling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Scale Narrative Management

**User Story:** As a player, I want my immediate choices to contribute to larger story arcs that unfold over different time scales, so that I can experience both immediate narrative satisfaction and long-term story development that feels meaningful and interconnected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player makes a choice THEN the system SHALL evaluate its impact across short-term (immediate scene), medium-term (character arc), long-term (world story), and epic-term (generational saga) narrative scales
2. WHEN narrative events occur THEN the system SHALL maintain causal relationships and thematic consistency across all temporal scales
3. WHEN story arcs progress THEN the system SHALL ensure that smaller narrative elements support and enhance larger story themes
4. IF narrative conflicts arise between different scales THEN the system SHALL prioritize player agency while maintaining story coherence
5. WHEN epic-scale events unfold THEN the system SHALL demonstrate how individual player actions contributed to larger narrative outcomes

### Requirement 2: Dynamic Character Arc Management

**User Story:** As a player, I want to interact with characters who have meaningful development arcs that respond to my choices and world events, so that I can build deep relationships and witness authentic character growth over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN characters are introduced THEN the system SHALL establish clear character motivations, growth trajectories, and potential arc variations based on player interaction
2. WHEN player choices affect characters THEN the system SHALL update character development paths while maintaining personality consistency and believable growth patterns
3. WHEN characters face challenges THEN the system SHALL generate responses that reflect their current development stage and relationship with the player
4. IF character arcs reach resolution points THEN the system SHALL provide satisfying conclusions while opening possibilities for new development phases
5. WHEN multiple characters interact THEN the system SHALL manage relationship dynamics and ensure character arcs complement rather than conflict with each other

### Requirement 3: Narrative Coherence Engine

**User Story:** As a player, I want the story world to feel consistent and logical even as it adapts to my choices, so that I can maintain immersion and trust in the narrative experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new narrative content is generated THEN the system SHALL validate consistency with established lore, character personalities, and world rules
2. WHEN contradictions are detected THEN the system SHALL either resolve them through creative narrative solutions or prevent inconsistent content generation
3. WHEN player choices create narrative branches THEN the system SHALL maintain logical cause-and-effect relationships across all possible paths
4. IF retroactive changes are needed THEN the system SHALL implement them through in-world explanations that preserve narrative integrity
5. WHEN multiple storylines converge THEN the system SHALL ensure smooth integration without plot holes or character inconsistencies

### Requirement 4: Therapeutic Story Integration

**User Story:** As a player, I want therapeutic concepts to be woven naturally into my story experience, so that I can explore personal growth themes through engaging narrative without feeling like I'm receiving direct therapy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN therapeutic themes are introduced THEN the system SHALL embed them organically within character arcs and story events rather than as explicit interventions
2. WHEN player emotional states are detected THEN the system SHALL guide narrative development toward relevant therapeutic concepts through story progression
3. WHEN characters model therapeutic concepts THEN the system SHALL demonstrate growth, resilience, and healing through believable character journeys
4. IF players resist therapeutic content THEN the system SHALL respect their boundaries while maintaining story quality and alternative growth opportunities
5. WHEN therapeutic milestones are reached THEN the system SHALL celebrate progress through meaningful story achievements and character recognition

### Requirement 5: Adaptive Story Pacing and Tension

**User Story:** As a player, I want the story to maintain appropriate pacing and emotional tension that keeps me engaged while respecting my therapeutic needs and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN story events unfold THEN the system SHALL monitor pacing to ensure appropriate buildup, climax, and resolution cycles across all narrative scales
2. WHEN tension levels are managed THEN the system SHALL balance dramatic engagement with player comfort levels and therapeutic appropriateness
3. WHEN player engagement patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL adjust story pacing to maintain optimal involvement without overwhelming the player
4. IF pacing issues are identified THEN the system SHALL implement corrective measures through character actions, world events, or narrative transitions
5. WHEN story climaxes occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate resolution and recovery periods before introducing new narrative tensions

### Requirement 6: Cross-Universe Narrative Continuity

**User Story:** As a player, I want my character's story to maintain continuity and meaning as I travel between different universes and worlds, so that I can experience a cohesive personal journey across diverse settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN players travel between universes THEN the system SHALL maintain character development continuity and carry forward relevant story elements
2. WHEN universe-specific events occur THEN the system SHALL integrate them with the player's overarching narrative journey
3. WHEN cross-universe connections are established THEN the system SHALL create meaningful narrative bridges that enhance rather than complicate the story
4. IF universe transitions create narrative challenges THEN the system SHALL provide creative solutions that maintain story logic and player agency
5. WHEN epic-scale stories span multiple universes THEN the system SHALL coordinate narrative elements to create a unified multi-dimensional experience

### Requirement 7: Player Choice Impact Tracking

**User Story:** As a player, I want to understand how my choices influence the story over time, so that I can see the meaningful consequences of my decisions and feel ownership of my narrative journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN players make significant choices THEN the system SHALL track their narrative impact across all temporal scales and story elements
2. WHEN choice consequences manifest THEN the system SHALL clearly connect outcomes to previous player decisions through story events and character reactions
3. WHEN players review their journey THEN the system SHALL provide insights into how their choices shaped character arcs, world events, and story outcomes
4. IF choice impacts conflict THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most recent or most significant player decisions while maintaining narrative logic
5. WHEN epic consequences unfold THEN the system SHALL demonstrate the cumulative effect of player choices on the larger story world

### Requirement 8: Emergent Narrative Generation

**User Story:** As a player, I want the story to surprise me with unexpected but logical developments that emerge from the interaction of my choices, character actions, and world events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN narrative elements interact THEN the system SHALL identify opportunities for emergent story developments that feel natural and engaging
2. WHEN emergent events are generated THEN the system SHALL ensure they enhance rather than disrupt existing story arcs and character development
3. WHEN unexpected developments occur THEN the system SHALL maintain logical connections to established narrative elements and player choices
4. IF emergent narratives create conflicts THEN the system SHALL resolve them through creative storytelling that strengthens overall narrative coherence
5. WHEN emergent stories conclude THEN the system SHALL integrate their outcomes into the ongoing narrative framework for future story development
