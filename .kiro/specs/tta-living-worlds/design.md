# Design Document

## Overview

The TTA Living Worlds system creates dynamic, persistent therapeutic environments that evolve based on player interactions, time passage, and accumulated history. Unlike static narrative environments, living worlds maintain state across sessions, develop complex character relationships and histories, and create timeline-based events that affect all world elements including characters, locations, and objects.

The system integrates seamlessly with existing TTA components including the Neo4j knowledge graph for persistence, the Interactive Narrative Engine for content generation, the Character Development System for rich NPC interactions, and the Therapeutic Agent Orchestrator for maintaining therapeutic appropriateness. The design emphasizes creating worlds that feel as complex and dynamic as real life while maintaining therapeutic safety, player agency, and meaningful therapeutic outcomes that support player growth and healing.

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Therapeutic Safety First**: All world evolution prioritizes player wellbeing and therapeutic outcomes
- **Player Agency**: Players have meaningful influence over how their world evolves through choices and actions
- **Persistent Continuity**: Worlds remember and reflect the impact of player actions across sessions
- **Adaptive Personalization**: Content adapts based on player preferences, comfort levels, and therapeutic progress
- **Administrative Oversight**: System administrators can monitor, configure, and intervene when necessary

#### Redis Caching Strategy

The system implements a comprehensive caching layer (LivingWorldsCache) with namespaced keys for optimal performance:

- **Active World State**: Current world state for active sessions with version tracking
- **Timeline Cache**: Recent timeline events with automatic invalidation on updates
- **Character State Cache**: Active character states, relationships, and generated histories
- **Location State Cache**: Current location states, recent changes, and environmental data
- **Object State Cache**: Object histories, interaction events, and lifecycle data
- **Performance Metrics**: Cache hit rates, response times, and system health indicators

**Cache Invalidation Strategy:**
- Timeline updates trigger invalidation of affected entity caches
- World state changes invalidate related character, location, and object caches
- Administrative actions provide manual cache invalidation capabilities
- Automatic cache warming for frequently accessed world elements

## Error Handling

### Consistency Validation

- **Timeline Consistency**: Ensure events don't contradict each other or violate therapeutic guidelines
- **Character Consistency**: Validate personality changes are realistic and therapeutically appropriate
- **Location Consistency**: Ensure environmental changes make sense and support therapeutic goals
- **Relationship Consistency**: Validate relationship changes are logical and beneficial
- **Therapeutic Consistency**: Ensure all content maintains therapeutic safety and appropriateness

### Fallback Mechanisms

- **History Generation Failure**: Use simplified backstories with therapeutic safety validation
- **Timeline Corruption**: Rebuild from significant events while maintaining therapeutic continuity
- **Character State Corruption**: Reset to last known good state with therapeutic context preservation
- **Location State Issues**: Revert to base configuration while preserving player progress
- **Content Safety Violations**: Automatically filter or replace inappropriate content

### Error Recovery and Graceful Degradation

```python
class LivingWorldsErrorHandler:
    def handle_timeline_corruption(self, timeline_id: str) -> bool
    def recover_character_state(self, character_id: str) -> bool
    def validate_and_repair_world(self, world_id: str) -> RepairResult
    def rollback_world_changes(self, world_id: str, checkpoint: datetime) -> bool
    def handle_therapeutic_safety_violation(self, violation: SafetyViolation) -> SafetyResponse
    def graceful_system_degradation(self, error_type: str) -> DegradationStrategy

### Therapeutic Safety Escalation

- **Content Concerns**: Automatic escalation to administrative review
- **Player Distress Indicators**: Immediate therapeutic guidance activation
- **System Failures**: Graceful degradation with therapeutic continuity preservation
- **Crisis Situations**: Integration with professional oversight and intervention protocols

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- **Timeline Engine**: Event creation, ordering, and consistency
- **Character System**: Family tree generation, backstory creation
- **Location Evolution**: Environmental changes, seasonal updates
- **Object Lifecycle**: Aging, wear, interaction tracking

### Integration Testing

- **Complex Relationships**: Multi-generational character interactions
- **Environmental Changes**: Seasonal cycles and major events
- **Player Impact**: How player choices affect world evolution

### Performance Considerations

- **Timeline Pruning**: Remove old, insignificant events while preserving therapeutic milestones
- **Lazy Loading**: Load detailed history only when needed with intelligent prefetching
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-tier caching with Redis for hot data and intelligent cache warming
- **Background Processing**: Handle evolution during off-peak times with therapeutic priority queuing
