# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Model Management & Selection System provides users with flexible options for AI model deployment and usage within the TTA platform. This system enables dynamic model selection based on task requirements, supports multiple model providers (local, OpenRouter, custom APIs), and includes intelligent fallback mechanisms. The system prioritizes user choice while maintaining therapeutic safety standards and optimal resource utilization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a TTA user, I want to choose between local models, OpenRouter models, or my own API keys, so that I can use the most appropriate and cost-effective AI models for my therapeutic sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses model configuration THEN the system SHALL present options for local models, OpenRouter, and custom API providers
2. WHEN a user selects local models THEN the system SHALL display available local models with resource requirements and performance metrics
3. WHEN a user selects OpenRouter THEN the system SHALL provide filtering options to show free models prominently
4. WHEN a user provides custom API keys THEN the system SHALL validate the keys and store them securely
5. IF a user has not configured any models THEN the system SHALL guide them through the setup process with clear recommendations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a TTA administrator, I want the system to automatically select the most appropriate model for each task, so that therapeutic interactions are optimized for quality and resource efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a therapeutic task is initiated THEN the system SHALL evaluate task requirements against available models
2. WHEN multiple suitable models are available THEN the system SHALL select based on performance benchmarks, cost, and resource availability
3. WHEN a selected model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL automatically fallback to the next best alternative
4. WHEN model performance degrades THEN the system SHALL switch to a backup model and log the incident
5. IF no suitable models are available THEN the system SHALL notify the user with clear guidance on resolving the issue

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a TTA user, I want to easily filter and discover free models on OpenRouter, so that I can use high-quality AI models without incurring costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user browses OpenRouter models THEN the system SHALL clearly mark free models with visual indicators
2. WHEN a user applies filters THEN the system SHALL support filtering by cost (free/paid), model type, and performance metrics
3. WHEN free models are displayed THEN the system SHALL show usage limits and rate restrictions
4. WHEN a user selects a free model THEN the system SHALL warn about potential limitations and suggest alternatives
5. IF OpenRouter API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL cache model information and provide offline browsing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a TTA developer, I want comprehensive model performance benchmarking, so that I can make informed decisions about model selection and system optimization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models are deployed THEN the system SHALL continuously monitor response time, accuracy, and resource usage
2. WHEN benchmarking is performed THEN the system SHALL test models against standardized therapeutic scenarios
3. WHEN performance data is collected THEN the system SHALL store metrics in a queryable format with historical trends
4. WHEN models are compared THEN the system SHALL provide side-by-side performance comparisons
5. IF performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and suggest optimizations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a TTA user, I want reliable fallback mechanisms when my preferred models fail, so that my therapeutic sessions are never interrupted by technical issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a primary model fails THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to a configured fallback model within 5 seconds
2. WHEN fallback occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain session context and continue seamlessly
3. WHEN multiple fallbacks are configured THEN the system SHALL try them in order of preference and capability
4. WHEN all configured models fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
5. IF fallback models have different capabilities THEN the system SHALL adapt the interaction appropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a TTA administrator, I want model versioning and update management, so that I can maintain system stability while incorporating model improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new model versions are available THEN the system SHALL notify administrators with change summaries
2. WHEN models are updated THEN the system SHALL support rollback to previous versions if issues occur
3. WHEN version changes are made THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing therapeutic sessions
4. WHEN models are deprecated THEN the system SHALL provide migration paths and timeline warnings
5. IF version conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL resolve them automatically or provide clear resolution steps

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a TTA user, I want secure API key management, so that my credentials are protected while enabling seamless model access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API keys are entered THEN the system SHALL encrypt them using industry-standard encryption
2. WHEN keys are stored THEN the system SHALL never log or display them in plain text
3. WHEN keys are used THEN the system SHALL validate them before making API calls
4. WHEN keys expire or become invalid THEN the system SHALL notify users and provide renewal guidance
5. IF key validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages without exposing sensitive information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a TTA user, I want resource-aware model deployment, so that local models don't overwhelm my system resources or impact therapeutic session quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN local models are selected THEN the system SHALL check available RAM, GPU memory, and CPU capacity
2. WHEN resource constraints are detected THEN the system SHALL recommend appropriate model sizes and configurations
3. WHEN models are running THEN the system SHALL monitor resource usage and provide real-time feedback
4. WHEN resource limits are approached THEN the system SHALL automatically scale down or suggest alternatives
5. IF insufficient resources are available THEN the system SHALL prevent model loading and suggest cloud alternatives
