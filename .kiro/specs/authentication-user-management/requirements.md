# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Authentication & User Management system provides secure user registration, authentication, and profile management for the TTA (Therapeutic Text Adventure) platform. This system ensures user privacy, supports multiple characters per user, and maintains therapeutic safety standards while providing seamless access to personalized therapeutic content.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register for an account with secure credentials, so that I can access personalized therapeutic content and maintain my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides valid registration information (email, password, basic profile) THEN the system SHALL create a new user account with encrypted credentials
2. WHEN a user provides an email that already exists THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message without revealing account existence
3. WHEN a user provides invalid email format or weak password THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation feedback
4. WHEN registration is successful THEN the system SHALL send a verification email and create a default user profile
5. IF email verification is not completed within 24 hours THEN the system SHALL mark the account as pending verification

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to securely log in to my account, so that I can access my therapeutic progress and continue my journey.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and create a secure session
2. WHEN a user provides invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL return a generic error message and implement rate limiting
3. WHEN a user fails authentication 5 times within 15 minutes THEN the system SHALL temporarily lock the account for 30 minutes
4. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL log the login event with timestamp and IP address
5. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication before accessing protected resources

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a logged-in user, I want to manage my session securely, so that my therapeutic data remains protected and I can safely use the platform across devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL create a secure session token with configurable expiration time
2. WHEN a user is inactive for more than 30 minutes THEN the system SHALL automatically expire the session
3. WHEN a user explicitly logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate the session token immediately
4. WHEN a user accesses the platform from a new device THEN the system SHALL require additional verification
5. IF multiple concurrent sessions are detected THEN the system SHALL allow the user to manage active sessions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create and manage multiple character profiles, so that I can explore different therapeutic scenarios and maintain separate progress tracks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new character THEN the system SHALL allow up to 5 characters per user account
2. WHEN a user creates a character THEN the system SHALL require a unique character name and basic therapeutic preferences
3. WHEN a user switches between characters THEN the system SHALL maintain separate progress, preferences, and therapeutic data
4. WHEN a user deletes a character THEN the system SHALL permanently remove associated data after confirmation
5. IF a user attempts to create more than 5 characters THEN the system SHALL provide upgrade options or character management guidance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my profile and therapeutic preferences, so that I can receive personalized content that aligns with my therapeutic goals and comfort level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user updates their profile THEN the system SHALL validate and save changes with audit logging
2. WHEN a user sets therapeutic preferences THEN the system SHALL apply these settings to content filtering and recommendations
3. WHEN a user modifies privacy settings THEN the system SHALL immediately apply changes to data visibility and sharing
4. WHEN a user updates sensitive information THEN the system SHALL require password confirmation
5. IF a user sets content restrictions THEN the system SHALL enforce these boundaries across all therapeutic interactions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a privacy-conscious user, I want comprehensive control over my data, so that I can manage my privacy and comply with my personal data protection needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests data export THEN the system SHALL provide a complete, machine-readable export within 30 days
2. WHEN a user requests account deletion THEN the system SHALL permanently remove all personal data within 30 days after confirmation
3. WHEN a user modifies privacy settings THEN the system SHALL clearly explain the implications of each setting
4. WHEN a user accesses their data THEN the system SHALL provide a clear audit trail of data access and modifications
5. IF a user opts out of data collection THEN the system SHALL maintain minimal data necessary for core functionality only

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust security monitoring and user management capabilities, so that I can maintain platform security and support users effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL log security events and alert administrators
2. WHEN a user reports a security concern THEN the system SHALL provide secure channels for reporting and investigation
3. WHEN user data is accessed by administrators THEN the system SHALL log all access with justification and user notification
4. WHEN security policies are updated THEN the system SHALL notify affected users and provide clear explanations
5. IF a security breach is detected THEN the system SHALL implement automated containment measures and user notifications

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a therapeutic content provider, I want user authentication to integrate seamlessly with therapeutic systems, so that users receive consistent, personalized therapeutic experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user authenticates THEN the system SHALL provide therapeutic context and preferences to content systems
2. WHEN therapeutic progress is updated THEN the system SHALL securely store progress data linked to the authenticated user
3. WHEN users interact with therapeutic content THEN the system SHALL maintain therapeutic boundaries and safety protocols
4. WHEN user therapeutic data is accessed THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based access controls for therapeutic staff
5. IF therapeutic safety concerns arise THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms for immediate intervention and support
