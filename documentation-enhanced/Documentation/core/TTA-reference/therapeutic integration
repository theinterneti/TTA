TTA - Therapeutic Integration
Introduction
The Therapeutic Text Adventure (TTA) project is founded on the belief that interactive narrative experiences can be powerful tools for self-discovery and emotional growth. While many games offer escapism, TTA aims to create a unique space where players can explore their inner worlds, confront personal challenges, and potentially experience a degree of healing. This section, "Therapeutic Integration," details how TTA is intentionally designed to subtly embed therapeutic concepts and techniques into the core gameplay loop without being didactic or intrusive. We are aiming for an experience that is both entertaining and potentially beneficial for players.
Our approach is rooted in several core principles. First, we prioritize player agency. The player's choices are paramount, ensuring that they are in control of their own journey. Second, we utilize concept-driven design. This means we build our worlds, narratives, and characters from universal concepts such as love, loss, justice, and betrayal, which allows for a deep exploration of human experience. Third, AI collaboration is at the heart of our design. AI agents generate dynamic content, manage the game world, personalize the player experience, and ensure narrative consistency. Lastly, we emphasize interconnectedness. Player actions have meaningful consequences that can ripple across the multiverse.
By combining these elements, we strive to create an environment where therapeutic concepts are not imposed on the player but rather organically integrated into the game narrative, encouraging self-reflection and emotional processing in a subtle and non-intrusive manner.
Theoretical Framework
Our approach to therapeutic integration draws from narrative therapy, which posits that individuals make meaning of their lives through the stories they tell themselves and others. This approach aligns with our understanding that personal experience is interpreted through the lens of narrative. Narrative therapy emphasizes that people are not their problems; rather, problems are separate entities that can be explored and challenged. This approach prioritizes a collaborative, respectful, and optimistically curious environment, where the therapist (or in our case, the game) acts as an investigator or explorer of the client's experience. The client is seen as an equal partner with local knowledge that may initially be inaccessible. This framework aligns with our focus on player agency and collaborative storytelling.
Furthermore, we are aware of the importance of therapeutic documentation, which involves creating tangible records of a player's progress that can be revisited and celebrated. These documents include audio or video tapes, drawings, declarations, certificates, awards, and letters. While we will not be including physical documentation, our approach to character development, game history, and player choices can function as virtual documentation that reflects a player's unique journey through our multiverse. We plan to create interfaces for users to explore their journey, making progress tangible.
By adopting a narrative therapy approach, we aim to help players re-author their personal stories. Through exploring the multiverse and facing challenges, players can externalize their problems, discover hidden talents, and create new, more empowered narratives. This aligns with our design principle of creating meaningful, interconnected experiences.
Subtle Integration of Therapeutic Concepts
TTA does not directly present itself as a therapeutic intervention; instead, it offers opportunities for therapeutic exploration within the context of an engaging game. Therapeutic concepts are woven into the game through several mechanisms:
Concept Mapping: We use a knowledge graph to map and relate therapeutic concepts such as "Trauma," "Resilience," "Acceptance," "Self-Compassion," and "Mindfulness". These concepts act as building blocks for the game's worlds, characters, and narratives. By doing this, we allow our AI agents to create rich narratives informed by a therapeutic framework. We intend to use these concepts to generate content in ways that will emphasize exploration of these topics without ever using them as direct instruction.
Dynamic Narrative Generation: AI agents generate dynamic content based on player choices and game context. This means that players are not subject to a predetermined narrative, but their choices and actions will influence the narrative in ways that explore these therapeutic concepts. For example, if a player makes a choice that indicates a need for self-compassion, the game may offer situations where the player is given the opportunity to practice this skill.
Character Arcs: The characters in TTA are designed with depth and complexity, and their arcs often reflect the struggles and growth associated with therapeutic journeys. Characters may face challenges, experience setbacks, and ultimately find ways to overcome their difficulties, thus modeling the therapeutic process. The idea is not to create perfect characters but to create believable ones whose struggles are relatable and can be a source of insight.
Philosophical Dialog: Non-player characters (NPCs) may engage players in philosophical discussions, encouraging self-reflection on their own beliefs and values. These discussions are meant to provoke thought and self-inquiry in ways that resonate with the player’s own experience. The idea is not to instruct the player on what to think, but to create the opportunity for them to consider their own beliefs through the lens of a unique, fictional character.
Hidden Storylines: Secret storylines are revealed to players who explore the game world deeply. These storylines may offer a space for players to explore themes related to trauma, addiction, and self-discovery, while also feeling like a rewarding activity for the player. This method emphasizes exploration and player agency.
These various integration techniques are designed to create a nuanced approach to therapeutic engagement. Players are encouraged to interact with these concepts at their own pace. We do not aim to force them into any type of experience. Our goal is to provide a space for those who seek one.
Explanation and Reasoning:
Therapeutic Concepts as Building Blocks: This section emphasizes that therapeutic concepts are foundational to the game's structure, which informs how the system builds its narrative.
Knowledge Graph: The section explains how the knowledge graph facilitates the use of these concepts. This highlights a major component of our technology.
AI-Driven Dynamic Narrative: It emphasizes that AI agents will generate dynamic narratives based on player choices. This shows the core loop of how the system creates experiences for players.
Character Arcs: The text discusses how characters model the therapeutic process. By creating relatable character arcs, the therapeutic principles become more tangible for the player.
Philosophical Dialog: The section explains how philosophical dialog can promote self-reflection, emphasizing self-inquiry as a therapeutic strategy.
Hidden Storylines: It introduces the concept of hidden storylines as a means to further explore therapeutic themes. These can provide a space for optional therapeutic exploration.
Subtle Approach: The section repeatedly emphasizes the subtlety of the integration. It makes it clear that the goal is not to force a therapeutic experience.
Player Choice and Agency
Player agency is foundational to TTA’s therapeutic approach. Players are not passive recipients of a predetermined narrative but active participants who shape their experience through their decisions. This approach is in alignment with narrative therapy's focus on empowering the client as the author of their own story. The choices that players make have a significant impact on the game world and the characters that inhabit it. This includes choices about character development, interactions with other characters, navigation of the game world, and the pursuit of game goals. These choices also help the player to reflect on their own decision-making processes, their personal values, and their approaches to overcoming problems.
Our AI agents are designed to respond dynamically to these choices, creating an experience that is personalized and meaningful for each player. For instance, if a player makes a decision that is consistent with a particular character archetype, the AI will recognize this and react accordingly, building a world around the player’s experience. If the player chooses to engage in acts of selflessness, the game may reward this with positive narrative outcomes. If the player demonstrates a propensity towards self-sabotage, the game will present the player with the consequences of that behavior. By allowing players to actively shape their experience, we are creating an environment where they can explore their behaviors and beliefs within a safe, consequence-rich context.
AI Collaboration and Therapeutic Guidance
AI agents serve multiple roles in TTA, acting as storytellers, world managers, and subtle therapeutic guides. These agents are designed to facilitate the player's journey while ensuring that the experience remains engaging and meaningful. The agents act as collaborative partners.
Dynamic Content Generation: AI agents dynamically generate narrative content, characters, locations, and events. This ensures that the player experience is not static.
Personalized Narrative: Based on the player’s choices, actions, and expressed preferences, the AI can tailor the narrative to explore specific therapeutic concepts and themes. This may be as simple as emphasizing aspects of certain characters and storylines, while downplaying others, based on player input and actions.
Lore Keeper Agent: The Lore Keeper Agent ensures consistency within the game world and acts as a resource for the player, offering information and contextual details that can deepen engagement. This agent works to provide context for the player and ensure the consistency of the game world and its narrative, which can help establish a sense of safety, which is important for therapeutic applications.
Subtle Therapeutic Cues: AI agents are designed to offer subtle therapeutic cues and prompts in the form of questions and comments embedded in the game text. For example, if a player struggles with a difficult challenge, the AI may offer an in-game character that helps the player think through their problem.
No Direct Instruction: The AI avoids direct therapeutic instruction. Its role is not to give advice but to provide opportunities for reflection and self-discovery through the experience of the game.
Metaprompts: Metaprompts, which are high-level guidelines for the AI agents, are used to manage agent behavior and ensure a consistent approach. For example, metaprompts help the AI to prioritize narrative coherence, maintain a balance between realism and fantasy, and respect player privacy. These metaprompts guide the overall game structure and facilitate the AI's efforts to create narratives consistent with our therapeutic goals.
Adaptive Metaprompt Selection: We plan to develop algorithms for dynamic metaprompt selection, which will use player profiles and game state to guide the AI's behavior.
Interconnectedness and Meaningful Consequences
The principle of interconnectedness means that player actions have consequences that ripple across the game world and the multiverse. The actions of each player have a unique impact on the stories they author. This provides a sense of agency and ownership of each story.
Dynamic World State: The game world is not static, and it changes in response to player actions and choices. This means that different players will encounter unique challenges and opportunities based on their decisions.
Character Relationships: Player choices can also influence relationships with NPCs, creating a dynamic network of connections and consequences within the game world. These relationships can have profound impacts on the way that players experience the game.
Multiverse Interactions: While we are still working on the mechanics of this, we aim to connect players across the multiverse in ways that reflect the impact of individual actions on a larger scale. This approach reinforces the idea that individual choices have far-reaching consequences.
By creating an environment of interconnectedness, TTA emphasizes that each player has agency and their actions matter. This creates a unique, collaborative, and personalized experience for each player.
Explanation and Reasoning:
Consequences: This section emphasizes the interconnectedness of the game world, where player actions have meaningful consequences. The purpose is to provide players with a sense of agency and ownership over their experience.
Dynamic Environment: It explains that the game world changes dynamically based on player actions and choices.
Relationship Impact: It emphasizes that player choices can influence character relationships, adding depth to the game narrative.
Multiverse Connections: It also points toward plans for connecting players across the multiverse in future iterations, which allows for a sense of individual actions having a large impact.
Agency and Ownership: The section makes it clear that the purpose is to give the player agency and ownership over their experience.
Ethical Considerations
Ethical considerations are paramount in TTA’s design. We are committed to player safety, well-being, and the responsible use of AI.
Player Privacy: We collect only necessary player data and ensure data is anonymized whenever possible. We seek to obtain informed consent for data collection and usage.
Avoiding Harm: Our goal is not to exploit or manipulate the player. We designed TTA to avoid harmful stereotypes and biases.
Responsible AI: We acknowledge the potential risks of AI and intend to use it responsibly. We have incorporated considerations into our AI agents to ensure they will act ethically. We will continually monitor and adjust AI behavior to align with ethical standards.
Transparency: We seek to provide players with enough information about the game’s mechanics to ensure they can make informed choices about their engagement with the game.
Conclusion
TTA’s approach to therapeutic integration is designed to be both nuanced and comprehensive. By focusing on player agency, concept-driven design, AI collaboration, and interconnectedness, we aim to create a game that is not only engaging but also potentially therapeutic. Our approach is based on narrative therapy and seeks to create a space for self-discovery and growth without direct instruction.
TTA offers a safe, consequence-rich environment where players can explore their inner world and re-author their personal narratives. We aim to provide players with an experience that encourages self-reflection and personal growth, but is not intended to be a replacement for therapeutic intervention or psychological care.
We are committed to the ethical use of AI and the protection of player privacy. We will continue to refine our approach based on feedback and further development as we iterate and test.
