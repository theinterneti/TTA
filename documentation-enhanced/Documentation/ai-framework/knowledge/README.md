# TTA Knowledge System

## Overview

This directory contains documentation for the knowledge system used in the TTA project, including the knowledge graph, vector database, and unified knowledge manager.

## Contents

1. [Knowledge System Overview](knowledge-system.md): Overview of the knowledge system used in the TTA project
2. [Knowledge Graph](knowledge-graph.md): Information about the knowledge graph
3. [Vector Database](vector-database.md): Information about the vector database
4. [Unified Knowledge Manager](unified-knowledge-manager.md): Information about the unified knowledge manager

## Knowledge System Components

The TTA project uses a sophisticated knowledge system with several components:

### Knowledge Graph

The knowledge graph is used for:
- Storing structured information about the game world
- Representing relationships between entities
- Supporting complex queries and reasoning

### Vector Database

The vector database is used for:
- Storing and retrieving embeddings
- Semantic search
- Similarity matching

### Unified Knowledge Manager

The unified knowledge manager is used for:
- Providing a consistent interface to knowledge sources
- Coordinating knowledge retrieval and storage
- Managing knowledge updates and synchronization

## Knowledge Integration

The knowledge system is integrated with:
- AI agents for knowledge-based reasoning
- Dynamic tool system for knowledge-based actions
- User interface for knowledge-based interactions
