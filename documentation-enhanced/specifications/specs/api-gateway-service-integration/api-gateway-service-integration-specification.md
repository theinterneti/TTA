# API Gateway Service Integration Specification

**Status**: ✅ OPERATIONAL **API Gateway Service Integration Implemented** (2024-12-19)
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Implementation**: src/api_gateway/
**Owner**: tta-dev-team@example.com
**Reviewer**: tta-dev-team@example.com

## Overview

The API Gateway Service Integration provides a unified entry point for all TTA services, delivering centralized routing, authentication, rate limiting, and service discovery. This system consolidates existing fragmented API endpoints across different components (tta.dev, tta.prototype, tta.prod) into a cohesive, scalable architecture that supports both RESTful APIs and WebSocket connections for real-time therapeutic interactions.

**Current Implementation Status**: ✅ **OPERATIONAL** (December 2024)
- Complete unified API gateway architecture with centralized routing and service discovery
- Comprehensive authentication and authorization with JWT integration and role-based access control
- Advanced rate limiting and throttling with therapeutic safety measures
- WebSocket proxying for real-time therapeutic interactions and communication
- Circuit breaker patterns with health monitoring and automatic failover
- Production-ready API gateway infrastructure for therapeutic service integration

The system serves as the primary interface between client applications and the distributed TTA services, ensuring consistent security policies, monitoring, and therapeutic safety measures across all service interactions.
