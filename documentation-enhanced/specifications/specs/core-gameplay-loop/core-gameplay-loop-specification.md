# Core Gameplay Loop Specification

**Status**: ðŸš§ IN_PROGRESS **Therapeutic Systems Integrated** (2024-12-19)
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Implementation**: src/core_gameplay/
**Owner**: tta-dev-team@example.com
**Reviewer**: tta-dev-team@example.com

## Overview

The Core Gameplay Loop is the central orchestration system that manages the flow of therapeutic text adventure experiences. This system coordinates between player actions, narrative progression, therapeutic interventions, and world state management to create cohesive and therapeutically effective gaming sessions.

**Current Implementation Status**: ðŸš§ **IN_PROGRESS** (December 2024)
- GameplayLoopController operational with therapeutic integration
- Session state management with Redis persistence
- Integration with 9 therapeutic systems established
- Real-time narrative progression and choice processing
- Crisis intervention and safety monitoring integrated
- Performance optimization for sub-millisecond response times

The system serves as the primary coordination layer between player experience, therapeutic content delivery, and narrative coherence, ensuring that all gameplay elements work together to achieve therapeutic objectives.
