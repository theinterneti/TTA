# Player Experience Component Start/Stop Policy Specification

**Status**: ✅ OPERATIONAL **Component Lifecycle Policy Implemented** (2024-12-19)
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Implementation**: src/player_experience/lifecycle/
**Owner**: tta-dev-team@example.com
**Reviewer**: tta-dev-team@example.com

## Overview

The Player Experience Component Start/Stop Policy defines the expected status semantics and lifecycle management for the PlayerExperienceComponent under orchestration. This system provides reliable component lifecycle management with graceful failure handling, health monitoring, and consistent orchestrator state management for production-ready therapeutic platform operations.

**Current Implementation Status**: ✅ **OPERATIONAL** (December 2024)

- Complete component lifecycle policy with start/stop behavior definitions
- Graceful failure handling with consistent orchestrator state management
- Health monitoring with 60-second timeout and API confirmation
- Docker-compose integration with error handling and status transitions
- Production-ready lifecycle management for therapeutic platform components
- Comprehensive testing integration with CI/CD pipeline compatibility

The system serves as the reliable foundation for component lifecycle management within the TTA therapeutic platform orchestration.

## Status expectations

- RUNNING: Start succeeded and health check confirms API is up.
- STOPPED: Component is not running. Also used for graceful failure conditions such as an invalid docker-compose path or environment where we bail early without partial start.
- ERROR: Start/stop attempted but failed unexpectedly in a way that is not a known graceful failure.

## Start behavior

- Always invoke `docker-compose up -d` during start unless short-circuited by a confirmed healthy API.
- If `docker-compose` returns non-zero OR the compose directory is invalid:
  - Return `False` from start()
  - Set component status to STOPPED (graceful failure) so that orchestration integration tests can proceed deterministically.
- On success, wait for health up to 60s; if healthy, start() returns True and status transitions to RUNNING.

## Stop behavior

- Attempt `docker-compose down`.
- If compose errors or times out:
  - Treat as best-effort success; return True and allow status to STOPPED.
- Confirm API is not healthy within a short window.

## Rationale

- Using STOPPED for graceful failures keeps the orchestrator state consistent in tests and CI, while still providing a False return for start() to signal failure.
- Unexpected failures continue to mark ERROR to surface issues.
