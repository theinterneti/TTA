## Overview

The Authentication and User Management system provides secure user registration, authentication, and profile management for the TTA (Therapeutic Text Adventure) platform. This system ensures user privacy, supports multiple characters per user, and maintains therapeutic safety standards while providing seamless access to personalized therapeutic content with clinical-grade security and HIPAA compliance.

**Current Implementation Status**: âœ… **OPERATIONAL** (December 2024)
- Complete role-based authentication system with comprehensive test credentials
- Secure user registration, authentication, and profile management
- Multi-character support per user with therapeutic safety standards
- Integration with enhanced backend systems and clinical-grade reliability
- HIPAA-compliant security measures and therapeutic data protection
- Comprehensive test coverage with 44 passing authentication tests

The system serves as the secure foundation for all user interactions within the TTA therapeutic platform.

## Current Test Credentials System

The system includes a comprehensive role-based authentication system for development and testing:

| Role           | Username     | Password     | Interface Access | Permissions                           | Status        |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Patient/Player | test_patient | patient123   | localhost:5173   | Therapeutic gaming, progress tracking | âœ… Functional |
