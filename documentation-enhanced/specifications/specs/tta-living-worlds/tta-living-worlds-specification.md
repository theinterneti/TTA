# TTA Living Worlds Specification

**Status**: ðŸš§ IN_PROGRESS **Dynamic World Systems Integrated** (2024-12-19)
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Implementation**: src/living_worlds/
**Owner**: tta-dev-team@example.com
**Reviewer**: tta-dev-team@example.com

## Overview

The TTA Living Worlds system creates dynamic, persistent, and therapeutically meaningful virtual environments that respond to player actions, evolve over time, and provide immersive therapeutic contexts. This system manages world state persistence, player choice impact tracking, dynamic narrative environments, and therapeutic world building to create living, breathing therapeutic spaces.

**Current Implementation Status**: ðŸš§ **IN_PROGRESS** (December 2024)
- Dynamic world state management with Redis caching layer
- Player choice impact system with persistent consequences
- Therapeutic world building with clinical context integration
- Cross-session world persistence and evolution
- Integration with narrative systems and therapeutic frameworks
- Performance optimization for real-time world updates

The system serves as the foundational world management layer that creates immersive and therapeutically effective virtual environments for therapeutic text adventures.

- **ChoiceImpactTracker**: Player choice consequence analysis and implementation
- **TherapeuticWorldBuilder**: Therapeutic environment creation and management
- **EvolutionEngine**: Real-time world evolution and dynamic updates
- **PersistenceLayer**: Cross-session world state storage and retrieval

### Data Flow Description
1. World state initialization and therapeutic context establishment
2. Real-time player interaction and choice impact processing
3. Dynamic world evolution and therapeutic environment updates
4. Cross-session world state persistence and continuity management
5. Player choice consequence analysis and therapeutic feedback
6. Immersive therapeutic environment maintenance and optimization

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
