# Redis Caching Layer Specification

**Status**: ✅ OPERATIONAL **Redis Caching System Implemented** (2024-12-19)
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Implementation**: src/tta_living_worlds/caching/
**Owner**: tta-dev-team@example.com
**Reviewer**: tta-dev-team@example.com

## Overview

The Redis Caching Layer provides high-performance caching for active world state, character states, and recent timeline events to optimize therapeutic world interactions. This system ensures cache invalidation on updates, maintains consistency with Neo4j, and delivers sub-millisecond access to frequently accessed therapeutic world elements for enhanced player experience and clinical effectiveness.

**Current Implementation Status**: ✅ **OPERATIONAL** (December 2024)

- Complete Redis caching layer with world state and character state caching
- Cache invalidation strategies with Neo4j consistency maintenance
- Cache warming for frequently accessed therapeutic world elements
- Observability with hit rate metrics and invalidation counters
- Performance optimization with write-through/write-behind policies
- Production-ready caching infrastructure for therapeutic world interactions

The system serves as the high-performance caching foundation for the TTA Living Worlds therapeutic platform.

## Purpose

Provide a high-level plan for Task 10: cache active world state, character states, and recent timeline events for performance. Ensure cache invalidation on updates and maintain consistency with Neo4j.

## Scope

- Cache keys and namespaces
- Data models to cache (world state snapshot, character states, recent events)
- Invalidation strategies (timeline event writes, world flag updates, entity mutations)
- Cache warming for frequently accessed elements
- Consistency policies (write-through vs. write-behind; TTLs; versioning)
- Observability (hit rate metrics, invalidation counters)

## Proposed Keyspace

- lw:world:{world_id}:state
- lw:world:{world_id}:flags
- lw:world:{world_id}:timeline:{entity_id}:recent
- lw:world:{world_id}:character:{char_id}:state
- lw:world:{world_id}:location:{loc_id}:state
- lw:world:{world_id}:object:{obj_id}:state

## Invalidation

- On timeline_engine.add_event: invalidate lw:world:{world_id}:timeline:{entity_id}:recent
- On world_state flag change: invalidate lw:world:{world_id}:flags
- On entity mutate (create/update/delete): invalidate corresponding state keys
- Use version increments lw:world:{world_id}:ver to coordinate readers

## Warming

- On world initialization or activation: prefill flags, world snapshot, and top-k recent events per active entity
- Background refresher updates popular timelines based on access metrics

## Consistency

- Prefer write-through for critical flags and world snapshot; write-behind acceptable for derived caches (recent events)
- Set TTLs for derived data; persistent keys (flags) without TTL but with versioning

## Observability

- Track metrics: cache_hits, cache_misses, invalidations, warm_count
- Expose a simple /metrics or logging counters for initial phase

## Testing

- Unit tests for key formatting and invalidation
- Integration tests asserting cache population, invalidation on event writes, and consistency with underlying data

## Risks / Open Questions

- Avoid caching sensitive player data; ensure privacy
- Ensure cache backpressure does not degrade persistence path
- Establish safe defaults when Redis unavailable
