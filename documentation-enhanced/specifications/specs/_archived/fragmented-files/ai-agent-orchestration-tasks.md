- [x] 7. Implement dynamic tool system integration

- [x] 7.1 Create tool coordination and sharing mechanisms

  - Design and implement ToolSpec (Pydantic) with: name, version, description, args_schema (JSON-schema or Pydantic model ref), returns_schema, capabilities (tags), safety_flags, created_at, last_used_at, owner (agent_id optional)
  - Implement comprehensive validation and safety checks:
    - Name/description sanitization and length limits; version semantic validation
    - Args/returns schema validation via Pydantic; cap total parameters and max nesting depth
    - Security controls: disallow filesystem/network/process execution unless explicitly whitelisted by config; enforce allowlist of Python callables when wrapping functions
    - Capability verification: ensure declared capabilities match actual callable behavior signature
  - Create a centralized Redis-backed ToolRegistry with lifecycle management:
    - Keys: {pfx}:tools:{name}:{version} -> JSON ToolSpec; {pfx}:tools:index -> set of "{name}:{version}"; {pfx}:tools:status:{name}:{version} -> status (active|deprecated)
    - API: register_tool(spec), get_tool(name, version=None -> latest), list_tools(prefix=None), deprecate_tool(name, version), touch_last_used(name, version), cleanup_expired(max_idle_s)
    - Concurrency: idempotent registration (SETNX) and per-key async locks for local process safety
  - Implement ToolCoordinator for dynamic generation and sharing across agents:
    - create_or_get(signature, factory_fn, \*, policy): deduplicate by stable signature hash of ToolSpec/args_schema; on miss, build via factory_fn, validate, register, return
    - Provide thread/async-safety for multi-agent access; integrate error handling and fallbacks (return safe stub or deny)
  - Diagnostics: extend /metrics JSON with tools summary (total, active, deprecated, cache_hits, cache_misses) and per-tool exec stats when available; include in Prometheus export when diagnostics enabled
  - Ensure thread-safety and concurrent access patterns for multi-agent tool sharing
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 7.2 Add tool optimization and caching infrastructure

  - Implement in-memory LRU cache for ToolSpec lookups with configurable TTL and max_items to prevent redundant tool generation
  - Track tool performance metrics: execution time histogram, success/failure counts, error_rate; tie into existing metrics aggregation and diagnostics
  - Automated cleanup and resource management for unused/expired tools: background task scans last_used_at and deprecates or prunes Redis entries beyond max_idle_s (configurable)
  - Add tool usage analytics and basic optimization recommendations (e.g., suggest promoting frequently used dynamic tools to static, or adjusting TTL/eviction)
  - Implement tool versioning policy and backward compatibility checks when updating ToolSpec
  - Testing: unit tests for validation and caching; Redis-marked tests for registry lifecycle, deprecation, concurrent register/get, and cleanup using existing fixtures (@pytest.mark.redis, redis_client)
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 7.3 Configuration-driven policy system and timeouts (Task 2)

  - Implemented ToolPolicyConfig and load*tool_policy_config supporting YAML/JSON via TTA_TOOL_POLICY_CONFIG and environment fallbacks (TTA_ALLOWED_CALLABLES, TTA_ALLOW*\*, TTA_TOOL_TIMEOUT_MS, etc.)
  - ToolPolicy accepts config; added get_timeout_ms, is_capability_allowed, validate_safety_flags; maintained validate_callable_allowed and schema depth checks
  - Enforced timeouts in ToolCoordinator.run_tool (async via asyncio.wait_for; sync via thread join(timeout)); recorded metrics on timeouts
  - InvocationService validates safety flags and callable allowlist before execution; BaseTool.execute wired to central policy loader
  - Added docs/configs with README and sample YAML/JSON configurations

- [x] 7.4 Advanced test coverage for policy, metrics, and registry (Task 3)

  - KG-enabled tools testing with network policy enforcement (allow/deny)
  - Metrics for failure scenarios: exceptions, timeouts, policy violations; keys as {tool}:{version}
  - Registry idempotency with concurrent create_or_get and invocation
  - Policy enforcement matrix across safety flag combinations and policy booleans
  - All tests marked @pytest.mark.redis and aligned with project fixtures; execution times < 5s each

- [x] 7.5 Policy config live-reload and diagnostics

  - Implemented diagnostics exposure of the current Tool Policy with proper redaction of sensitive fields (api_key, token, password, secret, key, auth)
  - Added optional file-based live-reload for policy configuration (polling watcher, validation-before-apply, audit logging, rollback on invalid config)
  - Added administrative endpoints for manual reload, validation, and status reporting
  - Extended /metrics JSON to include a redacted policy snapshot for quick inspection
  - Comprehensive tests added for diagnostics exposure, manual reload, live-reload application, and rollback scenarios (all @pytest.mark.redis, using existing fixtures)
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 4.5, 8.1_

  Implemented endpoints and functionality:

  - GET /policy — returns redacted policy snapshot and schema limits (max_params, max_schema_depth), plus recent reload audit entries
  - POST /policy/reload — manually reloads policy from TTA_TOOL_POLICY_CONFIG (or env) with optional admin key
  - POST /policy/validate — validates a posted policy config JSON without applying; guarded by optional admin key
  - GET /policy/status — shows config source (file path or env), last reload timestamp, and whether live-reload is enabled
  - /metrics — policy section attached with redacted snapshot; diagnostics unchanged otherwise

  Live-reload semantics:

  - Disabled by default; enable via agent_orchestration.diagnostics.policy_live_reload_enabled
  - Watches TTA_TOOL_POLICY_CONFIG file mtime at configurable interval; on change: load -> validate -> apply under lock; audit each event; rollback by not applying invalid configs

  Configuration schema updates:

  ```yaml
  agent_orchestration:
    tools:
      redis_key_prefix: "ao" # reuse default prefix
      cache_ttl_s: 300 # LRU TTL for ToolSpec lookups
      cache_max_items: 512 # LRU capacity
      max_params: 16 # safety: cap total args
      max_schema_depth: 5 # safety: cap nesting
      allow_network_tools: false # security defaults
      allow_filesystem_tools: false
      max_idle_seconds: 86400 # prune tools unused for 24h
    diagnostics:
      enabled: true
      # Admin + policy live-reload controls
      admin_api_key: "change-me" # optional; guards admin endpoints
      policy_live_reload_enabled: true # optional; default false
      policy_live_reload_interval_s: 2.0 # optional; default 2.0
      # Tool execution diagnostics (existing)
      allow_tool_execution: false
      tool_exec_api_key: null # optional
      allowed_tools: [] # optional e.g., ["math.add:*", "kg.query:1.*"]
      tool_exec_timeout_s: 10.0
      max_tool_exec_per_min: 30
  ```

  Additional suggestions for future enhancements:

  - Track and expose a config version/hash in /policy/status to assist auditing and rollbacks
  - Add explicit rate-limiting/auth to read endpoints (e.g., /policy) for environments with stricter requirements
  - Make the redaction key list configurable to accommodate organization-specific secret fields
  - Optionally switch to watchdog-based file watching where adding the dependency is acceptable, reducing reload latency

  Test coverage reference:

  - tests/agent_orchestration/test_policy_live_reload_and_diagnostics.py — covers redaction, diagnostics endpoints, manual reload with admin key, and live-reload apply/rollback

Note: Integrated with existing Redis patterns and test markers; all diagnostics functionality remains gated by agent_orchestration.diagnostics.enabled.

## 6. Enhancements and Operations Notes (Completed + Future)

### Completed in 6.x

- Redis-backed AgentRegistry with heartbeat-based liveness (ttl/interval configurable)
- Auto-registration of proxies (IPA, WBA, NGA) with per-agent instance naming (explicit or generated unique defaults)
- Diagnostics /agents endpoint with derived per-instance performance metrics (p50, p95, avg, error_rate) and last_heartbeat_age
- Deregistration of locally registered agents on controlled shutdown to avoid "ghost" agents

- Test infrastructure stabilization (Neo4j readiness)

  - Added Neo4j Testcontainers readiness probe in tests/conftest.py with 10s initial wait plus 10 retries using exponential backoff capped at 8s (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8). Non-blocking behavior maintained: on exhaustion, credentials are yielded to allow client-side retries.
  - Hardened neo4j_driver fixture to perform its own readiness verification with retries before yielding a driver.
  - Updated tests/test_player_profile_database_param.py to require neo4j_driver in container-mode paths, eliminating auth timing races by forcing an authenticated session prior to constructing repository/schema classes.
  - Agent Orchestration diagnostics and reliability tests continue to pass under Redis+Neo4j markers; DB tests stabilized via the driver-first dependency.

### Configuration (documented)

- agent_orchestration.agents.heartbeat_ttl: float seconds (default: 30.0)
- agent_orchestration.agents.heartbeat_interval: float seconds (default: ttl/3)
- agent_orchestration.agents.auto_register: bool (default: false)
- agent_orchestration.agents.{ipa|wba|nga}.enabled: bool (default: false)
- agent_orchestration.agents.{ipa|wba|nga}.instance: string (optional explicit instance name)

Example:

```yaml
agent_orchestration:
  diagnostics:
    enabled: true
  agents:
    auto_register: true
    heartbeat_ttl: 30.0
    heartbeat_interval: 10.0
    ipa:
      enabled: true
      instance: "worker-1"
    wba:
      enabled: true
    nga:
      enabled: true
```

### Future enhancements (planned)

- Per-agent multi-instance auto-registration (array support):

  ```yaml
  agent_orchestration:
    agents:
      ipa:
        enabled: true
        instances: ["a", "b", "c"]
      wba:
        enabled: true
        instances: ["w1"]
      nga:
        enabled: true
        instances: []
  ```

  - Auto-register one proxy per listed instance; continue to generate unique defaults when not provided.

- Resource recommendations per instance (to feed ResourceManager decisions in future):
  ```yaml
  agent_orchestration:
    agents:
      ipa:
        instances:
          - name: "a"
            resources:
              cpu_threads: 2
              ram_bytes: 536870912 # 512MB
          - name: "b"
            resources:
              cpu_threads: 1
      # same for wba, nga
  ```
