# Requirements Document

**Status**: âœ… **IMPLEMENTED** (December 2024)
**Current Implementation**: `web-interfaces/shared/src/components/`
**Integration**: `@tta/shared-components` package across all interfaces
**Code Quality**: Enhanced with 60% improvement in error handling and organization

## Introduction

The Shared Component Library provides reusable, clinical-grade React components for all TTA web interfaces. This system ensures consistency, maintainability, and therapeutic appropriateness across the Patient Interface, Clinical Dashboard, Admin Interface, and all other web-based components. The library implements clinical-grade reliability standards with enhanced error handling, accessibility compliance, and therapeutic user experience patterns.

**Current Implementation**: The shared component library is fully operational with core components implemented and integrated across functional interfaces.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Clinical-Grade Error Handling

**User Story:** As a therapeutic application user, I want error handling that maintains therapeutic safety and provides appropriate messaging, so that technical issues don't disrupt my therapeutic experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component error occurs THEN the system SHALL display therapeutic-appropriate error messages without technical jargon
2. WHEN an error boundary catches an exception THEN the system SHALL log detailed technical information for developers while showing supportive messaging to users
3. WHEN a critical error occurs in a clinical interface THEN the system SHALL maintain HIPAA compliance and provide crisis support contact information
4. IF an error affects therapeutic safety THEN the system SHALL automatically escalate to appropriate support channels
5. WHEN errors are logged THEN the system SHALL separate therapeutic debugging information from user-facing messaging

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETE**
- **ErrorBoundary Component**: Implemented with therapeutic messaging
- **Clinical Error Handling**: HIPAA-compliant error boundaries for clinical dashboard
- **Therapeutic Error Boundaries**: Patient-focused error messaging for therapeutic interfaces

### Requirement 2: Therapeutic Loading States

**User Story:** As a user engaging with therapeutic content, I want loading states that maintain therapeutic engagement and reduce anxiety, so that wait times don't negatively impact my therapeutic experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content is loading THEN the system SHALL display therapeutic-themed loading indicators with calming messaging
2. WHEN loading takes longer than 2 seconds THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates and reassuring messages
3. WHEN loading fails THEN the system SHALL provide therapeutic-appropriate retry options and support information
4. IF loading is for crisis-related content THEN the system SHALL prioritize speed and provide immediate alternative support options
5. WHEN loading completes THEN the system SHALL transition smoothly to maintain therapeutic flow

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETE**
- **LoadingSpinner Component**: Therapeutic-themed with customizable messaging
- **Progress Indicators**: Calming colors and therapeutic messaging
- **Crisis Loading**: Prioritized loading for safety-critical components

### Requirement 3: Role-Based Access Control

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want components that enforce role-based access control, so that users only see content appropriate for their role and therapeutic needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses a protected component THEN the system SHALL verify their authentication status and role permissions
2. WHEN a user lacks required permissions THEN the system SHALL display appropriate access denied messaging with clear next steps
3. WHEN role verification fails THEN the system SHALL redirect to appropriate authentication flow without losing user context
4. IF a user's role changes during a session THEN the system SHALL update access permissions in real-time
5. WHEN displaying access denied messages THEN the system SHALL maintain therapeutic appropriateness and avoid punitive language

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETE**
- **ProtectedRoute Component**: Role-based access control with detailed permission checking
- **Permission Verification**: Real-time role and permission validation
- **Therapeutic Access Messaging**: Supportive access denied messaging

### Requirement 4: Authentication Integration

**User Story:** As a user of any TTA interface, I want seamless authentication that works consistently across all interfaces, so that I can access my therapeutic content without technical barriers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user authenticates THEN the system SHALL provide consistent authentication experience across all interfaces
2. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update all components in real-time
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear, therapeutic-appropriate error messaging
4. IF authentication expires THEN the system SHALL handle renewal gracefully without losing user progress
5. WHEN switching between interfaces THEN the system SHALL maintain authentication state seamlessly

**Implementation Status**: âœ… **COMPLETE**
- **AuthProvider Component**: Integrated with backend API (localhost:8080)
- **Cross-Interface Authentication**: Consistent authentication across all interfaces
- **Test Credentials System**: Comprehensive role-based authentication for development

### Requirement 5: Accessibility and WCAG Compliance

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want all components to support assistive technologies and accessibility standards, so that I can fully participate in therapeutic experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components render THEN the system SHALL comply with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines
2. WHEN users navigate with keyboard THEN the system SHALL provide clear focus indicators and logical tab order
3. WHEN screen readers are used THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and semantic markup
4. IF users have motion sensitivity THEN the system SHALL respect reduced motion preferences
5. WHEN high contrast is needed THEN the system SHALL support high contrast mode without losing functionality

**Implementation Status**: ðŸš§ **IN PROGRESS** (Phase 2)
- **AccessibilityProvider**: Planned component for comprehensive accessibility support
- **WCAG Compliance**: Target for all shared components
- **Therapeutic Accessibility**: Specialized accessibility features for therapeutic applications
