# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The TTA Living Worlds feature aims to create dynamic, evolving therapeutic environments that feel alive and responsive to player interactions. Unlike static narrative environments, living worlds will feature persistent state, evolving characters, changing environmental conditions, and adaptive content that grows and changes based on player engagement patterns, therapeutic progress, and choices.

This system will integrate with the existing TTA architecture, leveraging Neo4j for world state persistence, the narrative engine for content generation, and therapeutic guidance systems that ensure the experience remains engaging, personally meaningful, and therapeutically beneficial as worlds evolve. The living worlds will maintain therapeutic safety while providing rich, immersive experiences that support player growth and healing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to enter a world that remembers my previous visits and shows meaningful changes over time, so that I feel a sense of continuity and that my actions have lasting impact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player returns to a previously visited world THEN the system SHALL display persistent changes from their last visit
2. WHEN a player completes activities or makes significant choices in a world THEN the system SHALL update the world state to reflect their actions
3. WHEN environmental changes occur THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with the player's personal narrative arc and therapeutic journey
4. IF a player has been absent for an extended period THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate world evolution that reflects the passage of time while maintaining therapeutic continuity

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want the world's characters and environments to evolve based on my interactions and choices, so that the experience feels personalized and engaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player demonstrates growth or learning in specific areas THEN characters SHALL adapt their dialogue and behavior to reflect this development
2. WHEN a player faces challenges or setbacks THEN the world SHALL present supportive environmental elements and character interactions naturally within the narrative while maintaining therapeutic appropriateness
3. WHEN seasonal or temporal changes occur THEN the world SHALL reflect these changes in weather, lighting, and character activities
4. IF a player achieves significant story milestones THEN the world SHALL unlock new areas or reveal previously hidden elements

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure world evolution parameters and monitor player engagement, so that I can ensure the living world provides an optimal therapeutic gaming experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring a living world THEN the system SHALL provide controls for evolution speed, narrative focus areas, therapeutic content boundaries, and safety parameters
2. WHEN monitoring world state THEN the system SHALL provide analytics on player engagement patterns, therapeutic progress indicators, and story progression metrics
3. WHEN content concerns arise THEN the system SHALL allow manual intervention to adjust world parameters while maintaining therapeutic safety
4. IF automated world evolution conflicts with therapeutic goals THEN the system SHALL prioritize player wellbeing and therapeutic outcomes over strict narrative consistency

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want to influence how the world evolves through my choices and actions, so that I feel agency and ownership in my therapeutic gaming environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player makes significant choices THEN the world SHALL evolve to reflect the consequences of those decisions
2. WHEN a player consistently engages with specific world elements THEN those elements SHALL become more prominent and detailed
3. WHEN a player avoids or shows discomfort with certain elements THEN the world SHALL gradually reduce or modify those elements
4. IF a player expresses preferences for certain story themes or gameplay styles THEN the world SHALL adapt to incorporate more of those elements while maintaining therapeutic appropriateness

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system developer, I want the living worlds to integrate seamlessly with existing TTA components, so that the feature enhances rather than disrupts the current therapeutic gaming framework.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN living worlds are active THEN they SHALL maintain compatibility with existing character development systems
2. WHEN world state changes occur THEN they SHALL be properly stored in the Neo4j knowledge graph with appropriate therapeutic metadata
3. WHEN narrative guidance is needed THEN the living world SHALL interface correctly with the narrative engine, therapeutic guidance systems, and safety validation components
4. IF system resources become constrained THEN the living world SHALL gracefully reduce complexity while maintaining core functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want characters in the world to feel like real people with complex relationships, family connections, and personal histories, so that the world feels as rich and dynamic as the real world.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN characters are introduced THEN they SHALL have detailed family relationships including parents, siblings, and extended family where appropriate
2. WHEN characters interact THEN their behavior SHALL be influenced by their personal backstory, past events, and developed personality traits
3. WHEN time passes in the world THEN characters SHALL react to events and experiences in ways that contribute to their evolving personality and relationships
4. IF supporting characters are present THEN they SHALL have appropriate levels of detail relative to their importance in the narrative while maintaining believable connections to the world

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want locations and objects in the world to have their own histories and timelines of events, so that every element of the world feels like it has depth and accumulated experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player encounters a location THEN the system SHALL generate or retrieve a timeline of significant events that have occurred there
2. WHEN a player interacts with objects THEN those objects SHALL have accumulated history based on previous interactions and world events
3. WHEN events occur in the world THEN they SHALL be recorded on appropriate timelines for characters, locations, and objects affected
4. IF a player inquires about the history of any world element THEN the system SHALL dynamically generate relevant historical details based on accumulated timeline events

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a player, I want the living world to maintain appropriate content and a positive therapeutic experience even as it evolves, so that I always feel safe, comfortable, and engaged in the gaming environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN world content is generated or modified THEN it SHALL be validated against therapeutic content appropriateness guidelines and safety standards
2. WHEN potentially uncomfortable or triggering content might emerge THEN the system SHALL either prevent it or handle it sensitively within the therapeutic narrative framework
3. WHEN player behavior indicates disengagement or distress THEN the world SHALL subtly adapt to provide more supportive, therapeutic, and engaging elements
4. IF world evolution leads to negative player experiences or therapeutic setbacks THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust course to improve both engagement and therapeutic outcomes
