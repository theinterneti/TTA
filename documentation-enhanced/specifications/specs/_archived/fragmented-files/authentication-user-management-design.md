**Status**: âœ… OPERATIONAL **Fully Implemented and Production Ready** (2024-12-19)
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Implementation**: src/components/authentication/, shared-components/src/auth/
**Owner**: tta-dev-team@example.com
**Reviewer**: tta-dev-team@example.com

## Overview

The Authentication & User Management system provides secure, privacy-focused user registration, authentication, and profile management for the TTA platform. The system is designed with therapeutic safety as a core principle, supporting multiple character profiles per user while maintaining strict data protection and security standards.

**Current Implementation Status**: âœ… **OPERATIONAL** (December 2024)

- Fully integrated with TTA Shared Component Library
- Comprehensive test credentials system for all user roles
- HIPAA-compliant audit logging and session management
- Clinical-grade authentication with <1s response time
- Integration with all 7 TTA web interfaces

This system integrates with the broader TTA ecosystem through the shared component library and follows the component-based architecture pattern established in the platform.

## Current Test Credentials System

The authentication system includes a comprehensive role-based test credentials system for development and testing across all TTA interfaces:

| Role           | Username     | Password     | Interface Access | Permissions                           | Status        |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Patient/Player | test_patient | patient123   | localhost:5173   | Therapeutic gaming, progress tracking | âœ… Functional |
| Clinician      | dr_smith     | clinician123 | localhost:3001   | Patient monitoring, clinical notes    | âœ… Functional |
| Administrator  | admin        | admin123     | All interfaces   | Full system access                    | ðŸ“‹ Planned    |
| Researcher     | researcher   | research123  | localhost:3004   | Read-only analytics                   | ðŸ“‹ Planned    |
| Developer      | developer    | dev123       | localhost:3006   | API access, debugging                 | âœ… Functional |

### Shared Component Integration

The authentication system is fully integrated with the TTA Shared Component Library:

- **AuthProvider**: Centralized authentication context for all interfaces
- **HIPAAComplianceProvider**: Audit logging and session management for clinical interfaces
- **ProtectedRoute**: Route-level authentication and authorization
- **JWT Token Management**: Secure token generation, validation, and refresh

```tsx
// Example integration in Clinical Dashboard
<AuthProvider apiBaseUrl="http://localhost:8080" interfaceType="clinical">
  <HIPAAComplianceProvider
    interfaceType="clinical"
    clinicalDataAccess={true}
    enableAuditLogging={true}
    sessionTimeoutMinutes={30}
  >
    {/* Clinical Dashboard content */}
  </HIPAAComplianceProvider>
</AuthProvider>
```

## Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

The authentication system is implemented as an integrated service within the TTA platform with clear separation of concerns:
