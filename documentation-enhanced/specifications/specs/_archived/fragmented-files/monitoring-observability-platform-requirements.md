3. WHEN error patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL group similar errors and provide trend analysis
4. WHEN system availability drops below 99.5% THEN the system SHALL trigger escalation procedures
5. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL track resolution time and update alert status

### Requirement 3: Carbon Footprint Monitoring

**User Story:** As an ethical AI practitioner, I want to monitor and optimize the carbon footprint of AI operations, so that the therapeutic platform operates sustainably and responsibly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI models are invoked THEN the system SHALL track energy consumption using CodeCarbon integration
2. WHEN GPU resources are utilized THEN the system SHALL monitor power usage and carbon emissions
3. WHEN daily operations complete THEN the system SHALL generate carbon footprint reports with recommendations
4. WHEN carbon usage exceeds defined thresholds THEN the system SHALL suggest optimization strategies
5. WHEN model selection occurs THEN the system SHALL consider carbon efficiency alongside performance metrics

### Requirement 4: User Engagement Analytics

**User Story:** As a therapeutic content designer, I want detailed user engagement analytics while respecting privacy, so that I can improve therapeutic effectiveness and user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users interact with therapeutic content THEN the system SHALL track engagement patterns without storing personal information
2. WHEN therapeutic sessions occur THEN the system SHALL measure session duration, interaction frequency, and completion rates
3. WHEN users navigate the platform THEN the system SHALL analyze usage patterns to identify optimization opportunities
4. WHEN therapeutic outcomes are measured THEN the system SHALL correlate engagement metrics with anonymized progress indicators
5. WHEN analytics are generated THEN the system SHALL ensure all data is aggregated and anonymized to protect user privacy

### Requirement 5: System Health Monitoring

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want comprehensive system health monitoring with predictive capabilities, so that I can prevent issues before they impact therapeutic users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system components are running THEN the system SHALL continuously monitor health status and resource utilization
2. WHEN resource usage trends indicate potential issues THEN the system SHALL provide early warning alerts
3. WHEN dependencies (Neo4j, Redis, Docker services) experience problems THEN the system SHALL detect and report issues immediately
4. WHEN system capacity approaches limits THEN the system SHALL recommend scaling actions
5. WHEN health checks fail THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic recovery procedures where safe

### Requirement 6: Real-time Dashboard and Visualization

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want real-time dashboards with intuitive visualizations, so that I can quickly understand system status and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the monitoring dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real-time metrics with less than 5-second latency
2. WHEN viewing performance data THEN the system SHALL provide customizable time ranges and metric filtering
3. WHEN analyzing trends THEN the system SHALL offer interactive charts with drill-down capabilities
4. WHEN critical alerts occur THEN the system SHALL prominently display them on the dashboard with clear action items
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL support export to multiple formats (PDF, CSV, JSON)

### Requirement 7: Privacy-Compliant Logging

**User Story:** As a privacy officer, I want all monitoring and logging to comply with therapeutic privacy requirements, so that user confidentiality is maintained while enabling system observability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging user interactions THEN the system SHALL anonymize all personally identifiable information
2. WHEN storing session data THEN the system SHALL use encrypted storage with automatic expiration policies
3. WHEN generating analytics THEN the system SHALL ensure individual users cannot be identified from aggregated data
4. WHEN handling therapeutic content THEN the system SHALL apply additional privacy protections and access controls
5. WHEN data retention periods expire THEN the system SHALL automatically purge logs and metrics data

### Requirement 8: Integration with Existing TTA Architecture

**User Story:** As a TTA developer, I want the monitoring platform to integrate seamlessly with existing components, so that monitoring can be added without disrupting therapeutic services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN TTA components start THEN the monitoring system SHALL automatically discover and begin monitoring them
2. WHEN using the tta.sh CLI THEN monitoring commands SHALL be available for status checking and configuration
3. WHEN components communicate THEN the monitoring system SHALL track inter-service communication patterns
4. WHEN configuration changes occur THEN the monitoring system SHALL adapt without requiring service restarts
5. WHEN deploying updates THEN the monitoring system SHALL maintain continuity during rolling deployments

### Requirement 9: Scalable Data Storage and Retention

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want scalable storage for monitoring data with configurable retention policies, so that historical analysis is possible while managing storage costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN metrics data is generated THEN the system SHALL store it in a time-series database optimized for monitoring workloads
2. WHEN storage capacity approaches limits THEN the system SHALL automatically archive older data to cost-effective storage
3. WHEN retention policies are configured THEN the system SHALL automatically purge data according to defined schedules
4. WHEN querying historical data THEN the system SHALL provide efficient access to archived metrics
5. WHEN data volume increases THEN the system SHALL scale storage capacity automatically

### Requirement 10: Comprehensive Test Coverage

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the monitoring platform, I want comprehensive unit tests covering all monitoring scenarios, so that I can confidently make changes without breaking observability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are executed THEN they SHALL achieve at least 90% code coverage for all monitoring components
2. WHEN monitoring edge cases are identified THEN they SHALL be covered by specific test cases with clear assertions
3. WHEN alert conditions are tested THEN tests SHALL verify proper triggering and escalation behavior
