# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The API Gateway & Service Integration feature will create a unified entry point for all TTA services, providing centralized routing, authentication, rate limiting, and service discovery. This system will consolidate the existing fragmented API endpoints across different components (tta.dev, tta.prototype, tta.prod) into a cohesive, scalable architecture that supports both RESTful APIs and WebSocket connections for real-time therapeutic interactions.

The gateway will serve as the primary interface between client applications and the distributed TTA services, ensuring consistent security policies, monitoring, and therapeutic safety measures across all service interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unified API Gateway Architecture

**User Story:** As a client application developer, I want a single entry point for all TTA services, so that I can interact with the system through a consistent interface without managing multiple service endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client makes a request to the API gateway THEN the system SHALL route the request to the appropriate backend service based on URL path and service discovery
2. WHEN multiple services are available for the same functionality THEN the gateway SHALL implement load balancing to distribute requests evenly
3. WHEN a backend service is unavailable THEN the gateway SHALL return appropriate error responses and implement circuit breaker patterns
4. WHEN services are added or removed THEN the gateway SHALL automatically discover and update routing configurations without manual intervention
5. IF a request requires data from multiple services THEN the gateway SHALL support request aggregation and response composition

### Requirement 2: RESTful API Standardization

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want all API endpoints to follow consistent RESTful conventions, so that I can predictably interact with different TTA services using standard HTTP methods and response formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing any service through the gateway THEN all endpoints SHALL follow RESTful URL patterns (e.g., `/api/v1/players/{id}/characters`)
2. WHEN making requests THEN the system SHALL support standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) with appropriate semantic meaning
3. WHEN receiving responses THEN all APIs SHALL return consistent JSON response formats with standardized error structures
4. WHEN API versions change THEN the gateway SHALL support versioning through URL paths (e.g., `/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/`)
5. IF content negotiation is required THEN the gateway SHALL support Accept headers for different response formats

### Requirement 3: WebSocket Integration for Real-time Communication

**User Story:** As a therapeutic application user, I want real-time chat and narrative interactions, so that I can have seamless, immediate responses during therapeutic sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN establishing a WebSocket connection THEN the gateway SHALL authenticate the connection and route it to appropriate chat services
2. WHEN multiple users are in the same therapeutic session THEN the system SHALL support WebSocket broadcasting to all participants
3. WHEN a WebSocket connection is lost THEN the system SHALL implement automatic reconnection with session state preservation
4. WHEN therapeutic safety events occur THEN the WebSocket system SHALL immediately notify relevant services and users
5. IF message queuing is required THEN the gateway SHALL integrate with Redis for message persistence and delivery guarantees

### Requirement 4: Authentication and Authorization Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want centralized authentication and authorization for all services, so that security policies are consistently enforced across the entire TTA platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user authenticates THEN the gateway SHALL issue JWT tokens that are valid across all TTA services
2. WHEN accessing protected resources THEN the gateway SHALL validate JWT tokens and enforce role-based access control (RBAC)
3. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL support automatic token refresh without disrupting user sessions
4. WHEN therapeutic safety roles are required THEN the gateway SHALL enforce specialized permissions for clinical and administrative functions
5. IF OAuth integration is needed THEN the gateway SHALL support external identity providers while maintaining therapeutic data privacy

### Requirement 5: Rate Limiting and Traffic Management

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want intelligent rate limiting and traffic management, so that the system remains stable and responsive under varying load conditions while protecting therapeutic users from service disruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users make requests THEN the gateway SHALL implement per-user rate limiting based on configurable thresholds
2. WHEN therapeutic sessions are active THEN the system SHALL prioritize therapeutic traffic over administrative requests
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the gateway SHALL return HTTP 429 responses with appropriate retry-after headers
4. WHEN system load is high THEN the gateway SHALL implement adaptive rate limiting based on backend service health
5. IF DDoS attacks are detected THEN the system SHALL automatically implement IP-based blocking and alert administrators

### Requirement 6: Service Discovery and Health Monitoring

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automatic service discovery and health monitoring, so that the API gateway can dynamically adapt to service availability and maintain high system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services start or stop THEN the gateway SHALL automatically detect changes and update routing tables
2. WHEN performing health checks THEN the system SHALL monitor all backend services at configurable intervals
3. WHEN services become unhealthy THEN the gateway SHALL remove them from load balancing rotation and alert monitoring systems
4. WHEN services recover THEN the gateway SHALL automatically re-include them in traffic routing
5. IF service dependencies exist THEN the health monitoring SHALL cascade health status based on dependency relationships

### Requirement 7: Cross-Service Communication Protocols

**User Story:** As a backend service developer, I want standardized inter-service communication protocols, so that services can reliably communicate with each other through the gateway infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services need to communicate THEN the gateway SHALL support both synchronous HTTP and asynchronous message-based communication
2. WHEN service-to-service authentication is required THEN the system SHALL use service tokens or mutual TLS for secure communication
3. WHEN data consistency is critical THEN the gateway SHALL support distributed transaction coordination
4. WHEN services publish events THEN the system SHALL route events to appropriate subscribers through the gateway
5. IF message ordering is important THEN the gateway SHALL preserve message sequence for therapeutic narrative consistency

### Requirement 8: API Security and Therapeutic Safety

**User Story:** As a therapeutic content manager, I want comprehensive API security that includes therapeutic safety measures, so that all interactions through the gateway maintain appropriate clinical boundaries and user protection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing therapeutic content THEN the gateway SHALL scan requests and responses for potentially harmful content
2. WHEN crisis situations are detected THEN the system SHALL immediately escalate to appropriate therapeutic safety protocols
3. WHEN sensitive therapeutic data is transmitted THEN the gateway SHALL enforce encryption in transit and at rest
4. WHEN audit trails are required THEN the system SHALL log all therapeutic interactions with appropriate privacy protections
5. IF data privacy regulations apply THEN the gateway SHALL enforce HIPAA-compliant data handling and user consent management

### Requirement 9: Performance Optimization and Caching

**User Story:** As an end user, I want fast response times for all therapeutic interactions, so that my experience is smooth and engaging without technical delays disrupting therapeutic flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frequently accessed data is requested THEN the gateway SHALL implement intelligent caching with Redis integration
2. WHEN therapeutic narratives are generated THEN the system SHALL cache narrative components while maintaining personalization
3. WHEN static assets are served THEN the gateway SHALL implement CDN-style caching with appropriate cache headers
4. WHEN cache invalidation is needed THEN the system SHALL support selective cache clearing based on data dependencies
5. IF performance monitoring is required THEN the gateway SHALL track response times and automatically optimize routing decisions

### Requirement 10: Monitoring, Logging, and Observability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging of all API gateway activities, so that I can maintain system health, troubleshoot issues, and ensure therapeutic service quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requests flow through the gateway THEN the system SHALL log all requests with correlation IDs for distributed tracing
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the gateway SHALL capture detailed error information while protecting sensitive therapeutic data
3. WHEN performance metrics are needed THEN the system SHALL expose Prometheus-compatible metrics for monitoring dashboards
4. WHEN therapeutic safety events occur THEN the logging SHALL create audit trails suitable for clinical review
5. IF compliance reporting is required THEN the system SHALL generate reports on API usage, security events, and therapeutic interactions
