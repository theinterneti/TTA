## Known Issues and Limitations

### 1. Import Errors in Test Suite
**Issue**: Several test files have import errors preventing execution
**Affected Files**:
- `test_capability_system_integration.py`
- `test_end_to_end_validation.py`
- `test_performance_validation.py`
- `test_session_state_validation.py`

**Root Causes**:
- Missing or incomplete performance module implementations
- Circular import dependencies
- Outdated import paths

**Impact**: Prevents full test suite execution and coverage measurement

### 2. Virtual Environment Path Warnings
**Issue**: `VIRTUAL_ENV=venv` does not match project environment path `.venv`
**Impact**: Cosmetic warnings in uv commands
**Solution**: Environment variable cleanup needed

### 3. Test Reliability Issues
**Issue**: Some integration tests may be flaky due to container startup timing
**Mitigation**: Enhanced reliability utilities provide retry mechanisms
**Status**: Partially addressed, ongoing monitoring needed
