# Conversational Character Creation User Guide

Welcome to the Conversational Character Creation feature of TTA (Therapeutic Text Adventure). This innovative approach allows you to create your therapeutic companion through natural conversation rather than filling out traditional forms.

## What is Conversational Character Creation?

Conversational Character Creation is a therapeutic, chat-based interface that guides you through creating a personalized therapeutic companion. Instead of answering questionnaires, you'll engage in a supportive conversation that gradually builds your character's profile while maintaining a safe, therapeutic environment.

### Sample Conversation Flow

**Assistant**: "Welcome! I'm here to help you create a therapeutic companion that truly understands and supports you. This is a safe space where you can share as much or as little as feels comfortable. Shall we start by getting to know you a bit? What would you like me to call you?"

**You**: "Hi, you can call me Sarah. I'm a bit nervous about this whole thing, to be honest."

**Assistant**: "It's completely natural to feel nervous, Sarah. Many people feel that way when starting something new, especially something as personal as this. Your feelings are valid, and we'll go at whatever pace feels right for you. There's no pressure here - you're in complete control of what you share. What would help you feel more comfortable as we begin?"
