Get started with comprehensive E2E testing in 5 minutes!

## 🚀 5-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Install Browsers (1 min)
```bash
npm run browsers:install
# Or: npx playwright install chromium firefox webkit --force
```

### Step 2: Start Staging Environment (2 min)
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging-homelab.yml up -d
sleep 30  # Wait for services to start
```

### Step 3: Verify Services (1 min)
```bash
./scripts/validate-staging-environment.sh
```

### Step 4: Run Tests (1 min)
```bash
npm run test:staging
```

## 📋 Common Commands

### Run All Tests
```bash
npm run test:staging
```

### Run Specific Test Suite
```bash
# Complete user journey (OAuth → Gameplay)
npm run test:staging:journey

# Data persistence (Redis/Neo4j)
npm run test:staging:persistence

# Performance monitoring
npm run test:staging:performance

# All new comprehensive tests
npm run test:staging:all-comprehensive
```

### Run with Visible Browser
```bash
npm run test:staging:headed
```

### Run in Interactive Mode
```bash
npm run test:staging:ui
```

### Run in Debug Mode
```bash
npm run test:staging:debug
```

### Run on Specific Browser
```bash

npm run test:staging:webkit
```

### View Test Report
```bash
npm run test:staging:report
```

## 📊 What Gets Tested

### ✅ Complete User Journey

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Browsers Won't Install
```bash
# Kill stuck processes
pkill -f "chrome|firefox|webkit"

# Remove lockfiles
rm -rf ~/.cache/ms-playwright/__dirlock

# Try again
npm run browsers:install
```

### Tests Timeout
```bash
# Check if staging is running
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging-homelab.yml ps

# Check logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging-homelab.yml logs

# Restart services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging-homelab.yml restart
```

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check Redis
redis-cli -p 6380 ping

# Check Neo4j
curl -u neo4j:password http://localhost:7474/db/neo4j/exec

# Check PostgreSQL
psql -h localhost -p 5433 -U tta_user -d tta_staging_db
```

### Tests Fail with "Page not found"
```bash
# Verify frontend is running
curl http://localhost:3001

# Check API is running
curl http://localhost:8081/api/v1/health

# Check environment variables
echo $STAGING_BASE_URL
echo $STAGING_API_URL
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Tests pass when:
- ✅ All user flows complete without errors
- ✅ Data persists in Redis and Neo4j
- ✅ Performance meets budgets
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ All browsers compatible
- ✅ Responsive on all viewports
