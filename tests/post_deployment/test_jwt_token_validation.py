"""
Post-Deployment Tests: JWT Token Validation (Issue #2)

These tests verify that the JWT token fix remains effective after deployment.

Issue #2 Fix: JWT tokens now include an explicit 'player_id' field to ensure
proper player identification throughout the system.

Test Coverage:
- JWT tokens contain 'player_id' field
- 'player_id' matches expected user ID
- Backward compatibility with 'sub' field
- Token refresh maintains 'player_id'
- MFA flow preserves 'player_id'
