"""
Post-Deployment Tests: Frontend Deployment Verification (Issue #4)

These tests verify that the frontend deployment fix remains effective.

Issue #4 Fix: Frontend Docker builds now correctly copy from /app/build
(not /app/dist), use the correct build script, and include cache-busting
mechanisms to ensure fresh deployments.

Test Coverage:
- Frontend serves fresh build (not cached)
- index.html has no-cache headers
- Static assets have proper cache headers
- Frontend environment variables correctly injected
- Frontend can communicate with backend API

Note: These tests use httpx for HTTP requests instead of Playwright
for simplicity and faster execution. Full E2E tests with Playwright
are in tests/e2e/.
