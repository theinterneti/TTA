# TTA Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This section provides detailed information about the architecture of the TTA project, including system design, components, and integration patterns.

## Architecture Components

### 1. [System Architecture](system-architecture.md)
- High-level system design
- Component interactions
- Data flow

### 2. [AI Components](ai-components.md)
- AI agent roles and responsibilities
- Model integration
- Agent communication

### 3. [Knowledge Graph](knowledge-graph.md)
- Knowledge graph schema
- Data storage and retrieval
- Integration with AI components

### 4. [Dynamic Tool System](dynamic-tool-system.md)
- Tool generation and registration
- Tool selection and execution
- Integration with AI agents
