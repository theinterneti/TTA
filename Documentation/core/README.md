# TTA Core Documentation

## Overview

This section provides core documentation for the TTA project, including project overview, getting started guides, key concepts, and frequently asked questions.

## Project Overview

The Therapeutic Text Adventure (TTA) project combines AI capabilities with narrative content to create therapeutic text adventures. The project is organized into two main components:

1. **tta.dev**: AI development framework and tools
   - Machine learning models
   - Technical patterns
   - Development infrastructure

2. **TTA.prototype**: Therapeutic content implementation
   - Narrative content
   - User experience
   - Content integration

## Getting Started

To get started with the TTA project:

1. **Installation**: Follow the [Installation Guide](../setup/INSTALLATION.md) to set up the project.
2. **Environment Configuration**: Configure your environment using the [Environment Variables Guide](../setup/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md).
3. **Development**: Read the [Development Guide](../development/README.md) to start developing.
4. **Deployment**: Follow the [Deployment Guide](../deployment/README.md) to deploy the project.

## Key Concepts

### AI Framework

The TTA project uses a sophisticated AI framework that includes:

- **AI Agents**: Specialized AI agents for different tasks
- **Knowledge Graph**: A graph-based knowledge representation system
- **Dynamic Tool System**: A system for dynamically generating and using tools
- **Model Selection**: A strategy for selecting the appropriate AI model for each task

### Therapeutic Content

The therapeutic content in the TTA project includes:

- **Narrative Structure**: A structured approach to creating therapeutic narratives
- **User Experience**: A focus on creating a positive and therapeutic user experience
- **Content Management**: Tools and processes for managing therapeutic content

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: What is the TTA project?**
A: The TTA (Therapeutic Text Adventure) project is a platform that combines AI capabilities with narrative content to create therapeutic text adventures.

**Q: How is the project organized?**
A: The project is organized into two main components: tta.dev (AI development framework) and TTA.prototype (therapeutic content implementation).

### Technical Questions

**Q: What AI models does the project use?**
A: The project uses a variety of AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and specialized models for specific tasks. See the [Models Guide](../ai-framework/models/models-guide.md) for more information.

**Q: How does the knowledge graph work?**
A: The knowledge graph is a graph-based knowledge representation system that stores and retrieves information about the therapeutic content and user interactions. See the [Knowledge Graph Guide](../architecture/knowledge-graph.md) for more information.

### Development Questions

**Q: How do I contribute to the project?**
A: See the [Contributing Guidelines](../development/CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on how to contribute to the project.

**Q: How do I set up my development environment?**
A: See the [Installation Guide](../setup/INSTALLATION.md) for information on setting up your development environment.
