### Requirement 5.4: Environment Adaptation Based on Therapeutic Needs
✅ **COMPLETED** - Environment adaptation based on therapeutic needs and user state.

**Implementation Details:**
- `adapt_environment_to_therapeutic_needs()` method for dynamic environment modification

- Crisis support adaptations with maximum safety and protective environments
- Real-time adaptation based on user progress and therapeutic goals

## Core Functionality Implemented

### 1. Therapeutic Environment Generation
✅ **COMPLETED** - `generate_therapeutic_environment()` method

**Features:**
- Template-based generation system for consistency and therapeutic appropriateness
- Multiple therapeutic themes supported with specialized environments
- Randomized but controlled generation for variety while maintaining therapeutic value
- Safety level management based on therapeutic theme and user progress
- Customization support for user preferences and therapeutic needs

### 2. Environment Adaptation System
✅ **COMPLETED** - `adapt_environment_to_therapeutic_needs()` method

**Features:**
- Dynamic adaptation based on emotional state changes
- Crisis support mode with maximum safety and protective features
- Therapeutic progress-based adaptations
- Integration with world state management for persistent changes
- Narrative justification for all adaptations to maintain immersion

### 3. Therapeutic Enhancement Mechanisms
✅ **COMPLETED** - `create_setting_based_therapeutic_enhancement()` method

**Features:**
- Sensory integration enhancements (multi-sensory experiences, tactile elements, aromatherapy)
- Biofeedback integration (real-time wellness indicators, responsive environments)
- Narrative immersion enhancements (story elements, character presence, interactive narratives)
- Adaptive difficulty scaling based on user progress
- Progressive enhancement unlocking based on therapeutic milestones

## Technical Implementation

### Core Classes
- `TherapeuticEnvironmentGenerator` - Main environment generation and adaptation class
- `TherapeuticEnvironmentTemplate` - Template system for consistent environment generation
- `TherapeuticTheme` - Enumeration of supported therapeutic approaches
- `EnvironmentMood` - Mood classifications for therapeutic environments

### Key Methods
- `generate_therapeutic_environment()` - Creates new therapeutic environments
- `adapt_environment_to_therapeutic_needs()` - Adapts existing environments
- `create_setting_based_therapeutic_enhancement()` - Adds therapeutic enhancements
- `_initialize_environment_templates()` - Sets up default therapeutic templates

### Therapeutic Templates Implemented
1. **Mindfulness Garden** - Serene garden for contemplation and present-moment awareness
2. **Anxiety Relief Sanctuary** - Protective, enclosed space for comfort and anxiety reduction
3. **Hope's Sunrise Meadow** - Uplifting environment for depression support
4. **Healing Cave of Strength** - Protected space for trauma healing
5. **Confidence Peak** - Empowering mountain environment for self-esteem building
6. **Circle of Connection** - Gathering space for relationship building

### Environment Adaptation Types
- **Emotional State Adaptations**: Responsive to user's current emotional state
- **Crisis Support Adaptations**: Maximum safety and immediate support
- **Progress-Based Adaptations**: Evolving challenge levels based on therapeutic progress
- **Theme-Specific Adaptations**: Specialized modifications for different therapeutic approaches

### Enhancement Mechanisms
- **Sensory Integration**: Multi-sensory therapeutic experiences
- **Biofeedback Integration**: Real-time physiological awareness and training
- **Narrative Immersion**: Story-based therapeutic engagement
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Progressive challenge scaling
