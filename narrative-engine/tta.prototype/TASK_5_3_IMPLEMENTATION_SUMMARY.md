- Character interactions that feel authentic and supportive
- Choice points that allow user agency in learning process

#### ‚úÖ Reflection and Learning Opportunity Generation
- Contextual reflection prompts based on technique and user experience
- Multiple reflection frameworks (experiential, metacognitive, application-focused)
- Learning point identification and insight generation
- Follow-up action planning for continued practice

#### ‚úÖ Comprehensive Unit Tests
- Full test coverage for all major components
- Data model validation testing
- Integration testing with existing TTA systems
- Mock implementations for dependency-free testing

### 5. Integration with Existing Systems

**Enhanced `TherapeuticContentIntegration` class with:**
- `demonstrate_therapeutic_technique()` - Create technique demonstrations
- `execute_technique_step()` - Step-by-step technique execution
- `generate_technique_reflection()` - Post-demonstration reflection
- Enhanced therapy approach adaptation with technique recommendations

### 6. Data Models

**Core Data Structures:**
- `TechniqueStep` - Individual technique instruction steps
- `NarrativeScenario` - Complete technique demonstration scenarios
- `ReflectionOpportunity` - Learning and reflection moments
- `TechniqueType` - Enumeration of supported techniques
- `ScenarioType` - Types of narrative demonstration approaches
- `LearningObjective` - Educational goals for technique learning

### 7. Requirements Compliance

#### ‚úÖ Requirement 3.4
*"WHEN therapeutic techniques are introduced THEN the system SHALL demonstrate them through character actions and story scenarios"*

**Implementation:**
- Character-driven technique demonstrations with consistent personality
- Rich narrative scenarios that embed techniques naturally in story context
- Story events that showcase technique application in realistic situations
- Character actions that model proper technique execution

#### ‚úÖ Requirement 3.5
*"WHEN a therapeutic session concludes THEN the system SHALL provide reflection opportunities integrated into the story's natural conclusion"*

**Implementation:**
- Contextual reflection opportunities that emerge naturally from story
- Character-facilitated reflection that maintains narrative immersion
- Learning integration that connects technique practice to ongoing story
- Follow-up planning that bridges technique learning to future story events

## Testing and Validation

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Technique Demonstration
```python
demo_system = TherapeuticTechniqueDemo()
demonstration = demo_system.create_technique_demonstration(
    technique_type=TechniqueType.DEEP_BREATHING,
    context=narrative_context,
    session_state=session_state,
    user_preferences={'learning_style': 'guided'}
)
```

### Executing Technique Steps
```python
step_result = demo_system.execute_technique_step(
    demonstration_package=demonstration,
    step_number=1,
    user_response={'engagement_level': 'high'}
)
```

### Generating Reflection Opportunities
```python
reflection = demo_system.generate_reflection_opportunity(
    demonstration_package=demonstration,
    user_experience=user_experience_data,
    context=narrative_context
)
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Scenario Generation:** ~8-15 minutes estimated duration per technique
- **Step Execution:** Real-time with adaptive pacing
- **Reflection Generation:** 4-6 guiding questions with contextual insights
- **Memory Footprint:** Minimal with efficient data structures
- **Scalability:** Supports multiple concurrent technique demonstrations

## Future Enhancement Opportunities
