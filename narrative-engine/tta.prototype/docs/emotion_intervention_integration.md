# Emotion-Intervention Integration System

## Overview

The Emotion-Intervention Integration System is a comprehensive module that connects emotional state recognition with therapeutic interventions, providing emotion-based therapeutic content adaptation and safe exposure therapy opportunities within narrative contexts.

## Key Features

### 1. Emotion-Based Intervention Selection
- **Intelligent Mapping**: Maps emotional states to appropriate therapeutic interventions based on emotion type and intensity
- **Safety Validation**: Multi-level safety validation ensures interventions are appropriate for user's current state
- **Adaptive Content**: Dynamically adapts intervention content based on emotional context and user progress

### 2. Safe Exposure Therapy Management
- **Readiness Assessment**: Comprehensive assessment of user readiness for exposure therapy
- **Graduated Exposure**: Implements systematic, gradual exposure with safety controls
- **Narrative Integration**: Embeds exposure therapy within safe narrative contexts
- **Multiple Safety Layers**: Built-in escape mechanisms, grounding techniques, and contraindication checking

### 3. Crisis Detection and Response
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for crisis-level emotional states
- **Immediate Response**: Automatic activation of crisis protocols when needed
- **Safety Resources**: Provides immediate access to crisis support resources
- **Professional Referral**: Facilitates connection to professional mental health services

### 4. Comprehensive Safety Framework
- **Multi-level Validation**: Four levels of safety validation (Minimal, Standard, Enhanced, Maximum)
- **Contraindication Checking**: Prevents inappropriate interventions based on user state
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time emotional state monitoring during interventions
- **Emergency Protocols**: Immediate safety protocols for crisis situations

    primary_interventions: List[InterventionType]
    secondary_interventions: List[InterventionType]
    contraindicated_interventions: List[InterventionType]
    safety_considerations: List[str]
    adaptation_strategies: List[str]
    exposure_therapy_suitability: bool
    crisis_threshold: float
```

#### AdaptedIntervention
Represents a therapeutic intervention adapted for specific emotional context:
```python
@dataclass
class AdaptedIntervention:
    base_intervention_type: InterventionType
    emotional_context: EmotionalState
    adapted_content: str
    adaptation_rationale: str
    safety_level: SafetyValidationLevel
    narrative_integration_points: List[str]
    expected_emotional_outcomes: List[str]
    therapeutic_effectiveness_score: float
```

#### ExposureTherapySession
Defines a safe exposure therapy session:
```python
@dataclass
class ExposureTherapySession:
    exposure_type: ExposureTherapyType
    target_fear_or_trigger: str
    exposure_intensity: float
    narrative_scenario: str
    safety_measures: List[str]
    escape_mechanisms: List[str]
    grounding_techniques: List[str]
    session_duration_minutes: int
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Integration
```python
from emotion_intervention_integration import EmotionInterventionIntegrator

# Initialize integrator
integrator = EmotionInterventionIntegrator()

# Run integration
result = integrator.integrate_emotion_with_interventions(
    emotional_analysis, session_state, narrative_context
)

# Check results
if result['integration_success']:
    interventions = result['selected_interventions']
    exposure_session = result['exposure_therapy_session']
    safety_assessment = result['safety_assessment']
```

### Crisis Handling
```python
# System automatically detects crisis situations
if result['safety_assessment']['crisis_detected']:
    crisis_response = result['crisis_response']
    # Crisis protocols are automatically activated
    # Professional referral is recommended
    # Safety resources are provided
```

### Exposure Therapy
```python
from emotion_intervention_integration import SafeExposureTherapyManager

manager = SafeExposureTherapyManager()

# Assess readiness
assessment = manager.assess_exposure_readiness(
    emotional_state, session_state, "social anxiety"
)

if assessment['ready']:
    # Create safe exposure session
    session = manager.create_exposure_session(
        ExposureTherapyType.IMAGINAL,
        "social anxiety",
        emotional_state,
        narrative_context
    )
```

## Safety Protocols

### Safety Validation Levels

1. **Minimal**: Basic content safety checks
2. **Standard**: Comprehensive therapeutic safety validation
3. **Enhanced**: Extra safety for vulnerable users
4. **Maximum**: Crisis-level safety protocols

### Crisis Detection Criteria

- Emotional intensity > 0.8 for depression/hopelessness
- Explicit crisis indicators in user input
- High intervention failure rate
- Concerning behavioral patterns

### Contraindications

#### For Exposure Therapy:
- Active crisis state (intensity > 0.8)
- Severe trauma indicators
- Insufficient coping skills
- Poor therapeutic progress

#### For Intensive Interventions:
- Crisis-level emotional states
- Recent trauma
- Dissociation risk
- Lack of support system
