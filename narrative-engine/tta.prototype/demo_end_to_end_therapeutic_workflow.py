Demo: End-to-End Therapeutic Workflow

This demonstration script showcases the complete therapeutic workflow
capabilities validated in Task 13.3, including:
- Complete therapeutic journey from start to finish
- Crisis intervention and safety protocols
- Therapeutic content quality and appropriateness
- Integration between all core components

This serves as both a demonstration and a quick validation test.
