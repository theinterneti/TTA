# Object Lifecycle Manager Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Object Lifecycle Manager has been successfully implemented as part of Task 7 for the TTA Living Worlds feature. This component manages the complete lifecycle of objects in the living world, including creation, aging, wear simulation, interaction tracking, relationship management, and timeline integration.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Data Models (living_worlds_models.py)

Added the following new data models to support object lifecycle management:

#### WearEvent
- Represents wear or aging events for objects
- Tracks wear type, amount, description, timestamp, and cause
- Supports validation and serialization

#### ObjectState
- Represents the current state of an object
- Tracks condition, wear level, functionality, location, and owner
- Includes methods for applying wear and repair

#### ObjectRelationship
- Represents relationships between objects and other entities
- Supports ownership, location, dependency, and component relationships
- Includes strength and active status tracking

#### ObjectHistory
- Complete history tracking for objects
- Manages creation events, interactions, modifications, wear timeline
- Tracks ownership changes, location history, and relationships
- Provides comprehensive object lifecycle management

### 2. Object Lifecycle Manager (object_lifecycle_manager.py)

Core manager class with the following capabilities:

#### Object Creation
- `create_object_with_history()`: Creates objects with complete history tracking
- Supports initial properties, location, ownership, and creation context
- Integrates with timeline engine for event tracking

#### Aging and Wear Simulation
- `age_object()`: Ages objects over time with material-specific modifiers
- `simulate_object_wear()`: Simulates wear from usage events
- Material-specific aging rates (metal, wood, fabric, stone, etc.)
- Automatic wear event generation and timeline integration

#### Interaction Handling
- `handle_object_interaction()`: Processes object interactions
- Supports use, examine, repair, damage, modify interaction types
- Calculates appropriate wear based on interaction intensity and duration
- Creates timeline events for significant interactions

#### Relationship Management
- `update_object_relationships()`: Manages object relationships
- Supports adding, removing, and updating relationships
- Tracks ownership, location, dependency, and component relationships

#### History and Analytics
- `get_object_history()`: Retrieves complete object history
- `get_object_summary()`: Provides object state summary
- `get_manager_statistics()`: Manager-wide statistics
- `cleanup_old_events()`: Removes old, low-significance events

### 3. Supporting Classes

#### ObjectData
- Data class for object initialization
- Includes all necessary properties for object creation

#### WearState
- Result class for wear simulation operations
- Tracks before/after states and simulation results

#### Interaction
- Data class for object interactions
- Supports various interaction types with metadata

### 4. Timeline Integration

The Object Lifecycle Manager integrates seamlessly with the existing Timeline Engine:

- Creates object timelines on object creation
- Adds interaction events to timelines
- Records significant aging events
- Maintains chronological consistency

### 5. Comprehensive Testing

#### Unit Tests (test_object_lifecycle_manager.py)
- 26 comprehensive test cases covering all functionality
- Tests for object creation, aging, interactions, relationships
- Validation error handling and edge cases
- Manager statistics and cleanup operations

#### Integration Test (test_object_lifecycle_integration.py)
- Demonstrates full integration with timeline engine
- Shows complete object lifecycle from creation to aging
- Tests all interaction types and relationship management
- Validates timeline integration and event tracking

- Relationship strength tracking
- Active/inactive relationship states
- Comprehensive relationship management API

### 4. History Management

## Requirements Compliance

The implementation fully satisfies all requirements from the specification:

### Requirement 7.1 - Timeline Integration
✅ Objects have complete timeline tracking with creation, interaction, and aging events

### Requirement 7.2 - Historical Depth
✅ Objects maintain detailed interaction history, modification events, and wear timeline

### Requirement 7.3 - Event Recording
✅ All significant object events are recorded with appropriate significance levels

### Requirement 7.4 - Dynamic History
✅ Object histories are dynamically generated and can be queried with various filters

## Usage Examples

### Creating an Object
```python
manager = ObjectLifecycleManager(timeline_engine)

object_data = ObjectData(
    name="Legendary Sword",
    object_type="weapon",
    description="A legendary sword forged by ancient masters",
    initial_condition=1.0,
    properties={"material": "steel", "sharpness": 0.95},
    location_id="armory",
    owner_id="hero_character"
)

object_history = manager.create_object_with_history(object_data)
```

### Handling Interactions
```python
interaction = Interaction(
    object_id=object_id,
    character_id="hero_character",
    interaction_type="use",
    description="Hero uses sword in battle",
    intensity=0.8,
    duration_minutes=45
)

success = manager.handle_object_interaction(object_id, interaction)
```

### Aging Objects
```python
# Age object over 6 months
updated_state = manager.age_object(object_id, timedelta(days=180))
```

### Managing Relationships
```python
relationships = {
    'add': [
        {
            'to_entity_id': 'hero_character',
            'to_entity_type': 'character',
            'relationship_type': 'ownership',
            'strength': 1.0
        }
    ]
}

manager.update_object_relationships(object_id, relationships)
```

## Performance Considerations

- Event cleanup system to manage memory usage
- Configurable aging and wear rates
- Lazy loading of detailed history when needed
- Efficient relationship tracking with active/inactive states

## Future Enhancements

The Object Lifecycle Manager provides a solid foundation for future enhancements:

1. **Persistence Layer**: Integration with Neo4j for object history storage
2. **Advanced Wear Models**: More sophisticated wear calculations based on usage patterns
3. **Object Evolution**: Objects that change type or properties over time
4. **Crafting System**: Support for object creation and modification through crafting
5. **Economic Integration**: Value tracking and economic impact of object condition

## Conclusion

The Object Lifecycle Manager successfully implements comprehensive object lifecycle management for the TTA Living Worlds feature. It provides robust tracking of object histories, realistic aging and wear simulation, flexible relationship management, and seamless integration with the existing timeline system. The implementation is thoroughly tested and ready for integration with the broader living worlds ecosystem.
