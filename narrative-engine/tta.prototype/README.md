# TTA Prototype

This directory contains **experimental features** and **proof-of-concept** implementations for the Therapeutic Text Adventure (TTA) project. This is where new ideas are tested before potentially moving to production.

## üß™ Purpose

- **Experimental Features**: New capabilities being explored
- **Proof of Concepts**: Testing new approaches and technologies
- **Rapid Development**: Fast iteration without production constraints
- **Innovation Lab**: Space for creative and experimental solutions

## üî¨ Current Experiments

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

The `mcp/` directory contains experimental integration with the Model Context Protocol:

- **Agent Adapters**: Converting TTA agents to MCP servers
- **Server Management**: Dynamic MCP server lifecycle management
- **Protocol Extensions**: Custom MCP extensions for TTA-specific needs

### Advanced Model Testing

The `models/` directory contains experimental model evaluation and testing:

- **Model Comparison**: Automated testing across different models
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Measuring model performance on TTA-specific tasks
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Experimenting with model combinations

### Example Implementations

The `examples/` directory contains:

- **Custom Tool Examples**: Demonstrations of advanced tool creation
- **Agent Patterns**: Experimental agent interaction patterns
- **Integration Examples**: How to integrate with external systems

## üöÄ Getting Started

**Note**: Prototype code may be unstable and is not recommended for production use.

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Install production dependencies first
   pip install -r ../tta.prod/requirements.txt
   
   # Install additional prototype dependencies
   pip install -r requirements-prototype.txt  # If it exists
   ```

2. **Experimental Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Copy environment from production
   cp ../tta.prod/.env.example .env
   # Add any prototype-specific configuration
   ```

## üîß Current Prototypes

### MCP Server Integration

```python
from mcp.agent_adapter import create_agent_mcp_server
from tta.prod.src.agents import BaseAgent

# Create an agent
agent = BaseAgent("TestAgent", "Experimental agent")

# Convert to MCP server
mcp_server = create_agent_mcp_server(
    agent=agent,
    server_name="tta-test-agent",
    server_description="Experimental TTA agent via MCP"
)
```

### Advanced Model Testing

```python
from models.model_testing import ModelTester

tester = ModelTester()

# Test multiple models on TTA-specific tasks
results = await tester.compare_models(
    models=["gpt-4o-mini", "claude-3-haiku", "gemma-2-9b"],
    tasks=["narrative", "reasoning", "creative"],
    test_prompts=load_tta_test_prompts()
)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Stability Warning

- **Experimental Code**: May break or change without notice
- **No Backward Compatibility**: APIs may change frequently
- **Limited Testing**: May not have comprehensive test coverage
- **Documentation**: May be incomplete or outdated

### Development Guidelines

1. **Fail Fast**: It's okay for experiments to fail
2. **Document Learnings**: Record what works and what doesn't
3. **Iterate Quickly**: Prioritize speed over perfection
4. **Share Results**: Communicate findings with the team

## üîÑ Graduation Process

When a prototype proves successful, it may be promoted to production:

1. **Stabilization**: Code is refactored for stability
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite is added
3. **Documentation**: Full documentation is created
4. **Review**: Code review for production standards
5. **Migration**: Move to `tta.prod` with proper versioning

## üéØ Current Focus Areas

### Near-term Experiments

- **OpenHands Integration**: Local model management
- **Advanced Agent Patterns**: Multi-agent coordination
- **Real-time Streaming**: Live narrative generation
- **Context Management**: Advanced context handling

### Future Explorations

- **Multimodal Integration**: Image and audio support
- **Federated Learning**: Distributed model training
- **Edge Deployment**: Running on edge devices
- **Blockchain Integration**: Decentralized game state

## ü§ù Contributing

Prototype contributions are welcome and encouraged:

1. **Experiment Freely**: Try new approaches
2. **Document Experiments**: Record your process and results
3. **Share Early**: Don't wait for perfection
4. **Learn from Failures**: Failed experiments are valuable too

## üìä Experiment Tracking

Keep track of experiments in the `experiments/` directory:

- **Hypothesis**: What are you testing?
- **Approach**: How are you testing it?
- **Results**: What did you learn?
- **Next Steps**: What should be tried next?
