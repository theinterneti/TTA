"""
Task 13.3: End-to-End Therapeutic Workflows Validation

This standalone validation script tests complete therapeutic journeys from session
start to completion, validates integration between all core components, ensures
therapeutic content quality and appropriateness, tests crisis intervention and
safety protocols, and runs comprehensive integration tests to verify production readiness.

Requirements validated:
- 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5: Interactive narrative engine functionality
- 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5: Therapeutic content integration
- 7.5: Crisis intervention and safety protocols
