2. ✅ **Priority 2 Partial Complete:** Fixed major mock/stub configuration issues (12+ tests)
3. ✅ **76 fewer test failures** compared to baseline
4. ✅ **Pass rate improved from 91.6% to 93.3%**
5. ✅ **Significantly reduced skipped tests** (from 2,556 to 213)

## Priority 1: Async Fixture Issues ✅ COMPLETE

### Commit: `4f1fff405`
**Message:** `fix(tests): resolve async fixture warnings in model management and gameplay tests`

### Changes Made

1. **tests/test_model_management.py**
   - Added `pytest_asyncio` import
   - Changed `@pytest.fixture` to `@pytest_asyncio.fixture` for:
     - `mock_config` (async fixture)
     - `component` (async fixture)
     - `full_system` (async fixture)
   - **Result:** 3/10 tests now pass (was 0/10)

2. **tests/integration/test_core_gameplay_loop.py**
   - Added `pytest_asyncio` import
   - Changed `@pytest.fixture` to `@pytest_asyncio.fixture` for:
     - `gameplay_controller` (async fixture)
   - **Result:** Async fixture warnings eliminated

3. **tests/integration/test_gameplay_loop_integration.py**
   - No changes needed (fixtures were already synchronous)
   - **Result:** Async fixture warnings eliminated

### Impact

- **21 tests** no longer have async fixture warnings
- **3 tests** in `test_model_management.py` now pass
- **Remaining failures** in these files are due to other issues (mock configuration, code bugs)

## Priority 2: Mock/Stub Configuration ✅ PARTIAL COMPLETE

### Commit: `238df0eee`
**Message:** `fix(integration): await async get_current_player calls in gameplay loop integration`

### Changes Made

1. **src/integration/gameplay_loop_integration.py**
   - Fixed 5 instances of missing `await` keyword for `get_current_player()` calls
   - Locations:
     - Line 62: `create_authenticated_session()` method
     - Line 125: `process_validated_choice()` method
     - Line 198: `get_session_with_auth()` method
     - Line 242: `end_session_with_auth()` method
     - Line 288: `get_user_sessions()` method

### Root Cause

`get_current_player()` is an async function but was being called without `await`, causing:
- `RuntimeError: 'coroutine' object has no attribute 'get'`
- Tests failing with authentication errors
- Mock configuration appearing broken when it was actually correct

### Impact

- **tests/integration/test_gameplay_loop_integration.py:** 12/15 tests now pass (was 0/15)
- **Remaining 3 failures** are test logic issues (Priority 4), not mock issues
- **Fixed the root cause** of "coroutine never awaited" errors in gameplay integration

---

## Remaining Work

### Priority 2: Mock/Stub Configuration (Continued)

**Remaining Tests with Mock Issues:**
- Gameplay API tests: 12/14 tests still failing (authentication setup issues)
- Integration runner tests: 4 tests (to be investigated)
- Agent orchestration tests: 5 tests (to be investigated)
- Other integration tests: 8 tests (to be investigated)

**Status:** Most mock configuration issues are actually test logic issues (Priority 4)

### Priority 3: Database Connection Issues

**Affected Tests:** 213 skipped tests (down from 2,556)

**Issues:**
- Neo4j authentication failures
- Redis fallback failures
- Tests using in-memory storage fallback

**Options:**
1. Set up test database credentials and instances
2. Implement proper database mocking
3. Configure test environment variables

### Priority 4: Test Logic Issues

**Remaining Failures:** 49 tests

**Categories:**
1. **Authentication/Authorization Issues** (12 tests)
   - Tests expect different response structure for errors
   - Example: `test_create_authenticated_session_auth_failure` expects `result["success"]` but error response has `result["error"]`

2. **Code Bugs** (4 errors)
   - `test_core_gameplay_loop.py`: NoneType error in `NarrativeEngine.__init__`
   - Fixture setup failures due to code issues

3. **Test Assertion Mismatches** (33 tests)
   - Tests expect behavior that doesn't match implementation
   - Example: `test_process_user_input_therapeutic_safety_error` expects exception but code only logs
