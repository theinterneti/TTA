## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 24 Hours)
1. Monitor task execution: `python scripts/phase7_monitor_progress.py`
2. Track completion status of 47 submitted tasks
3. Collect generated artifacts as tasks complete

### Short-term (Next 7 Days)
1. Validate code quality (tests, coverage, linting, type checking)
2. Integrate generated artifacts into codebase
3. Create final comprehensive report with lessons learned

### Phase 8: Results Integration & Validation
1. Collect execution metrics
2. Validate generated code quality
3. Integrate results into codebase
4. Run full test suite
5. Document actual outcomes
