# OpenHands Integration (Paused)

We are no longer investing in the OpenHands integration inside this repository. All related assets (code, docs, tests, scripts) will be moved here during Phase 3 of the reorg so they stop cluttering the active agent orchestration stack.

Before re-enabling OpenHands, copy the desired pieces out of `legacy/openhands/` and run the validation scripts under `scripts/test_openhands_*` to confirm compatibility with current infrastructure.
