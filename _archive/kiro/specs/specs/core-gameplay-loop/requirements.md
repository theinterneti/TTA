# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Core Gameplay Loop system defines the heart of the TTA experience - the repeating cycle of adventure engagement that keeps users immersed, progressing therapeutically, and returning for continued growth. This system orchestrates the fundamental mechanics of storytelling, choice-making, consequence-experiencing, and progress-tracking that make therapeutic adventures compelling and effective.
