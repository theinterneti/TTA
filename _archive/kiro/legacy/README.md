# Archived Kiro Specifications

The `.kiro/` spec backlog is considered historical reference only. We are moving it under `legacy/kiro/` to prevent new coding agents from interpreting it as active delivery work. Keep the docs for archeology, but do not generate code from them unless product leadership explicitly revives the initiative.
