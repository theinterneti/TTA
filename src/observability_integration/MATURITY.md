## Promotion History

### Promotions

- **2025-10-27**: Promoted to Staging (73.53% coverage, all tests passing)

### Demotions

None

---

## Current Blockers

### Active Blockers

None - Component is staging-ready ✅

### Resolved Blockers

1. **Duplicate pyproject.toml section** (Resolved: 2025-10-27)
   - **Type**: Build Configuration
   - **Severity**: Medium
   - **Target Stage**: Staging
   - **Status**: Resolved - Merged duplicate `[project.optional-dependencies]` sections

---

## Rollback Procedure

### Quick Rollback

```bash
# Disable observability via environment variable
export ENABLE_OBSERVABILITY=false

# Restart main application
python src/main.py
```

### Full Rollback

1. Set `ENABLE_OBSERVABILITY=false` in environment
2. Restart application
3. Verify application runs without observability
4. Check logs for graceful degradation message
5. Remove observability integration code if needed

**Rollback Documentation**: This document

**Last Rollback Test**: Not tested (graceful degradation tested in unit tests)

**Graceful Degradation**: 
- APM initialization returns `False` when OpenTelemetry unavailable
- All primitives continue to work without metrics collection
- No-op mode ensures zero impact on core functionality

## Next Steps

### Short-term (Next Sprint)

- [ ] Create Prometheus scraping configuration (`monitoring/prometheus.yml`)
- [ ] Set up Grafana dashboards (System Overview, Primitives Performance)
- [ ] Write integration tests (end-to-end tracing validation)
- [ ] Document troubleshooting procedures

### Medium-term (Next Month)

- [ ] Run 7-day stability test in staging environment
- [ ] Performance benchmarking (APM overhead, cache hit rates)
- [ ] Security review (PII filtering, authentication)
- [ ] Create alert rules for critical metrics
- [ ] Increase test coverage to 80% (production requirement)

### Long-term (Next Quarter)

- [ ] Production deployment
- [ ] Implement advanced metrics collectors (ComponentMetrics, CircuitMetrics, LLMMetrics)
- [ ] Create comprehensive Grafana dashboard suite (6 dashboards per spec)
- [ ] Cost optimization validation (40% reduction target)
- [ ] Integration with distributed tracing (Jaeger/Tempo)

## Notes

### Implementation Notes

This component implements Phase 1 (APM Setup) and Phase 2 (Missing Primitives) of the observability integration roadmap. The implementation follows the wrapper-based pattern described in GitHub's agentic primitives article, providing:

1. **RouterPrimitive**: Intelligent routing between model providers based on complexity/cost
2. **CachePrimitive**: Redis-based caching with TTL and hit/miss tracking
3. **TimeoutPrimitive**: Asyncio timeout enforcement with grace periods

All primitives are designed for composition via the `>>` and `|` operators inherited from `WorkflowPrimitive`.

### Test Count Discrepancy

The PR description stated 57 tests, but actual implementation has 62 tests:
- APM Setup: 8 tests (as stated)
- Router: 15 tests (stated 16, -1)
- Cache: 16 tests (as stated)
- Timeout: 23 tests (stated 19, +4)

This is an improvement - more comprehensive test coverage than originally planned.

### Coverage Achievement

The 73.53% coverage exceeds the 70% staging threshold by 3.53%, demonstrating strong test coverage for a new component. The uncovered lines are primarily:
- Fallback type stubs when `tta-workflow-primitives` unavailable (lines 20-32 in each primitive)
- Observable gauge callbacks (advanced metrics features)
- Error paths in graceful degradation (hard to test without mocking SDK internals)
