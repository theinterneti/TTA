"""Safety Validation Component.

This component provides the foundation for therapeutic safety validation:
- Safety level definitions (SafetyLevel enum)
- Validation types (ValidationType enum)
- Validation result models (ValidationFinding, ValidationResult)
- Safety rule definitions (SafetyRule)
- Rule evaluation engine (SafetyRuleEngine)

This is the foundation layer that other components build upon.
