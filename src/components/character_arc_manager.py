Character Arc Manager Component

This module implements the Character Arc Manager component that manages dynamic
character development and relationship evolution within the TTA narrative system.

Classes:
    CharacterArcManagerComponent: Main component for character arc management
    CharacterArc: Data model representing a character's development arc
    ArcStage: Enumeration of character development stages
    ArcMilestone: Represents significant points in character development
    RelationshipState: Tracks relationship dynamics between characters
