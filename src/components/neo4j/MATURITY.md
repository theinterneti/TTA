# Neo4j Component Maturity Status

**Current Stage**: Staging (7-Day Observation Period)
**Deployed to Staging**: 2025-10-09
**Observation Period**: 2025-10-09 to 2025-10-16
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-09
**Owner**: theinterneti
**Functional Group**: Core Infrastructure
**Priority**: P1 (Week 2-3)

## ⚠️ CORRECTION NOTICE

**Previous Assessment**: 0% test coverage (INCORRECT)
**Corrected Assessment**: **27.2% test coverage** (OUTDATED)
**Current Assessment (2025-10-09)**: **0% test coverage**

The initial analysis used the wrong tool (`uvx pytest` instead of `uv run pytest`), resulting in false 0% readings. After correction, Neo4j appeared to have 27.2% coverage. However, further investigation revealed that the actual coverage is **0%** due to heavy mocking in tests.

**Root Cause**: Tests use extensive `@patch` decorators (20 total) that mock all functionality, preventing the actual `neo4j_component.py` module from being imported during test execution. Coverage.py cannot track code that is never imported.

**Evidence**:
```
CoverageWarning: Module src/components/neo4j_component.py was never imported. (module-not-imported)
CoverageWarning: No data was collected. (no-data-collected)
```

**Solution**: Refactor tests to reduce internal mocking and add integration tests with testcontainers. Estimated effort: 10-15 hours over 2-3 days.

**Detailed Analysis**: See [NEO4J_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md](../../docs/component-promotion/NEO4J_COVERAGE_ANALYSIS.md)

**New Priority**: P1 (requires test refactoring before staging promotion)

## Pilot Component Status

**Neo4j is the PILOT COMPONENT** for the TTA Component Maturity Promotion Workflow.

**Why Neo4j?**
- Foundational component (no dependencies)
- Relatively simple scope
- Well-understood technology
- Smallest blocker count (2 blockers)
- Cleanest codebase (type checking and security already passing)

**Success Criteria for Pilot**:
- ✅ All promotion criteria met
- ✅ Automated validation passed
- ✅ Deployment successful
- ✅ 7-day uptime ≥99.5%
- ✅ No critical issues in staging
- ✅ Lessons learned documented
- ✅ Process validated and refined

---

## Notes

This is the first component to go through the complete maturity promotion workflow. Lessons learned here will inform the promotion process for all other components.

**Estimated Time to Staging**: 1-2 weeks
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days of development work
