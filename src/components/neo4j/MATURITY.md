# Neo4j Component Maturity Status

**Current Stage**: Development
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-08 (CORRECTED)
**Owner**: theinterneti
**Functional Group**: Core Infrastructure
**Priority**: P1 (Week 2-3)

---

## ⚠️ CORRECTION NOTICE

**Previous Assessment**: 0% test coverage (INCORRECT)
**Corrected Assessment**: **27.2% test coverage**

The initial analysis used the wrong tool (`uvx pytest` instead of `uv run pytest`), resulting in false 0% readings. After correction, Neo4j has **27.2% coverage** with a **42.8% gap** to the 70% threshold.

**New Priority**: P1 (not P0)

See: [Corrected Assessment Report](../../docs/development/COMPONENT_MATURITY_ASSESSMENT_CORRECTED.md) | [Correction Issue #18](https://github.com/theinterneti/TTA/issues/18)

## Pilot Component Status

**Neo4j is the PILOT COMPONENT** for the TTA Component Maturity Promotion Workflow.

**Why Neo4j?**
- Foundational component (no dependencies)
- Relatively simple scope
- Well-understood technology
- Smallest blocker count (2 blockers)
- Cleanest codebase (type checking and security already passing)

**Success Criteria for Pilot**:
- ✅ All promotion criteria met
- ✅ Automated validation passed
- ✅ Deployment successful
- ✅ 7-day uptime ≥99.5%
- ✅ No critical issues in staging
- ✅ Lessons learned documented
- ✅ Process validated and refined

---

## Notes

This is the first component to go through the complete maturity promotion workflow. Lessons learned here will inform the promotion process for all other components.

**Estimated Time to Staging**: 1-2 weeks
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days of development work
