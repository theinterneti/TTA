# Gameplay Loop Maturity Status

**Current Stage**: Development (BLOCKED - Requires Architectural Refactoring)
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-22
**Owner**: theinterneti
**Functional Group**: Player Experience

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Architectural Debt

**Component Size**: 12,290 lines across 31 files, 4,072 statements
**Status**: BLOCKED for staging promotion
**Reason**: Large architectural monolith requiring refactoring before quality standards can be met

This component is too large and complex to test comprehensively in its current form. It must be refactored into smaller, focused components before staging promotion.

**Required Refactoring** (See Issue #57):
1. `choice_architecture/` - Choice generation, validation, agency protection
2. `narrative_engine/` - Narrative generation, scene management, pacing control
3. `consequence_system/` - Consequence tracking and therapeutic framing
4. `gameplay_database/` - Database operations, schema management
5. `gameplay_models/` - Data models (may remain as is if well-structured)
6. `gameplay_controller/` - Core orchestration layer

**Estimated Refactoring Effort**: 55-80 hours

## Maturity Criteria

### Development → Staging

- [x] Core features complete (80%+ of planned functionality)
- [ ] Unit tests passing (≥70% coverage) - **BLOCKED: 21.22% coverage (gap: -48.78%)**
- [ ] API documented, no planned breaking changes - **BLOCKED: 356 type errors**
- [ ] Passes linting (ruff), type checking (pyright), security scan (bandit) - **BLOCKED: 79 linting violations, 356 type errors**
- [ ] Component README with usage examples - **NEEDS VERIFICATION**
- [x] All dependencies identified and stable
- [ ] Successfully integrates with dependent components in dev environment - **PARTIALLY TESTED (7 failing tests)**

**Status**: 2/7 criteria met (29%)

**Current Metrics** (2025-10-22):
- **Test Coverage**: 21.22% (Target: 70%, Gap: -48.78%)
- **Linting**: 79 violations (Target: 0)
- **Type Checking**: 356 errors (Target: 0)
- **Security**: Not scanned (blocked by type errors)
- **Tests**: 7 failing integration tests
- **README**: Needs verification

**Estimated Effort to Meet Staging Criteria (Without Refactoring):**
- Fix 356 type errors: 20-30 hours
- Fix 79 linting violations: 5-10 hours
- Improve coverage from 21.22% to 70%: 40-60 hours
- Fix 7 failing tests: 5-10 hours
- **Total: 70-110 hours**

**Blockers**:
- **Issue #57**: Architectural refactoring required - Component is 12,290 lines, 4,072 statements (large monolith)
- Test coverage insufficient (21.22% vs 70% required) - Blocked by Issue #57
- 356 type errors - Blocked by Issue #57
- 79 linting violations - Blocked by Issue #57
- 7 failing integration tests - Blocked by Issue #57
