Character Arc Integration Module

This module provides integration between the new CharacterArcManager component
and the existing tta.prototype Character Development System. It handles data
synchronization, character arc data mapping, and relationship dynamics management
across both systems.

Classes:
    CharacterArcIntegration: Main integration class
    CharacterDataSynchronizer: Handles data sync between systems
    RelationshipDynamicsManager: Manages relationship evolution across systems
