- Conflict Detection: Identifies temporal, character, thematic, and therapeutic conflicts
- Impact Analysis: Analyzes ripple effects of narrative decisions across scales
- Resolution Engine: Proposes conflict resolutions while maintaining narrative coherence
- Scale Management: Coordinates narrative consistency across micro/meso/macro scales

**Dependencies**:
- None (self-contained component)
