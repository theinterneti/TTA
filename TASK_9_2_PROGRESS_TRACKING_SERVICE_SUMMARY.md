- **Sophisticated Analytics**: Added helper methods for streak calculation, dropout risk assessment, and therapeutic value evaluation

### 2. Milestone Detection and Achievement Celebration
- **Multi-Category Milestones**: 
  - Engagement streaks (3, 7, 14, 30, 60 days)
  - Session count milestones (5, 10, 25, 50, 100 sessions)
  - Skill acquisition levels (3, 5, 10, 20, 35 skills)
  - Breakthrough achievements (1, 3, 5, 10, 15 breakthroughs)
- **Achievement Celebration**: Added `celebrate_milestone_achievement()` with personalized celebration messages and therapeutic value assessment
- **Celebration Types**: Different celebration types (major_achievement, skill_mastery, progress_milestone) with appropriate messaging

### 3. Progress Insight Generation and Recommendation System
- **Enhanced Recommendations**: Comprehensive `generate_progress_insights()` with 6+ recommendation categories:
  - High momentum advancement recommendations
  - Dropout risk interventions
  - Skill development guidance
  - Session quality improvements
  - Therapeutic approach diversification
  - Consistency building support
- **Personalized Insights**: Context-aware recommendations based on individual progress patterns
- **Priority-Based Sorting**: Recommendations sorted by priority with top 6 returned

### 4. Therapeutic Effectiveness Reporting
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Added `generate_therapeutic_effectiveness_report()` for detailed therapeutic outcome assessment
- **Multiple Metrics**: Engagement consistency, skill acquisition rate, breakthrough frequency
- **Approach Effectiveness**: Analysis of most/least effective therapeutic approaches
- **Clinical Insights**: Emotional regulation, coping skills, and self-awareness growth tracking

### 5. Enhanced Data Models and Enums
- **New Progress Marker Types**: Added `INSIGHT` and `THERAPEUTIC_GOAL` to `ProgressMarkerType` enum
- **New Therapeutic Approaches**: Added `BEHAVIORAL_ACTIVATION`, `SKILL_BUILDING`, and `INSIGHT_ORIENTED` approaches
- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Enhanced progress models with strength/challenge area identification
