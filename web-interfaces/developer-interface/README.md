## Quick Start

### Development Mode

```bash
# Navigate to developer interface directory
cd web-interfaces/developer-interface

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Access at http://localhost:3006
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Or use Docker
docker build -t tta-developer-interface .
docker run -p 3006:3006 tta-developer-interface
```

### Using the Deployment Script

```bash
# Deploy all interfaces including developer interface
cd web-interfaces
./deploy.sh development deploy

# Access via nginx proxy at http://localhost/dev
```

## Interface Access

- **Direct URL**: `http://localhost:3006`
- **Proxy URL**: `http://localhost/dev` (via nginx)
- **Development Only**: Automatically disabled in production environments

## Key Components

### Dashboard
- System overview with real-time statistics
- Quick action buttons for common tasks
- Recent activity feed
- Performance overview with visual indicators

### Interface Hub
- Grid view of all TTA interfaces
- Embedded preview mode with fullscreen support
- Interface status monitoring
- Direct navigation to any interface

### Testing Tools
- Role-based authentication testing
- JWT token generation and validation
- Environment configuration management
- API endpoint testing with pre-configured requests

### Development Utils
- Live reload status for all interfaces
- Build monitoring with error reporting
- Performance metrics collection
- Log aggregation and filtering

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# API Configuration
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
REACT_APP_GATEWAY_URL=http://localhost:8000
REACT_APP_AGENT_URL=http://localhost:8503

# Development Features
REACT_APP_DEV_MODE=true
REACT_APP_DEBUG_MODE=true

# WebSocket Configuration
REACT_APP_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8080
```

### WebSocket Integration
Real-time monitoring connects to existing TTA backend WebSocket endpoints:

```typescript
// Connects to monitoring endpoints on each service
ws://localhost:8080/ws/monitoring  // Player Experience API
ws://localhost:8000/ws/monitoring  // API Gateway
ws://localhost:8503/ws/monitoring  // Agent Orchestration
```

**Event Types Supported**:
- `interface_health`: Real-time health status updates
- `build_status`: Live build completion notifications
- `live_reload`: Hot module replacement events
- `error_report`: Real-time error broadcasting
- `performance_metric`: Live performance data streaming

### Feature Flags

The interface automatically adjusts features based on the environment:

- **Development**: All features enabled, WebSocket monitoring active, debug tools available
- **Staging**: Limited features, error reporting enabled, WebSocket monitoring only
- **Production**: Automatically disabled for security (returns 404)

## Security Considerations

### Development Only
- Interface is automatically disabled in production environments
- Environment detection prevents accidental production exposure
- Optional authentication with bypass for local development

### Access Control
- Developer JWT authentication (optional)
- Environment-based feature restrictions
- Secure token handling and validation

## Integration

### nginx Configuration
The interface is integrated into the existing nginx reverse proxy:

```nginx
location /dev {
    proxy_pass http://developer-interface:3006;
    # WebSocket support for live features
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
}
```

### Docker Integration
Included in the main docker-compose.yml:

```yaml
developer-interface:
  build: ./developer-interface
  container_name: tta-developer-interface
  ports:
    - "3006:3006"
  environment:
    - NODE_ENV=development
    - REACT_APP_DEV_MODE=true
```

## Usage Examples

2. Select desired user role (patient, clinician, admin)
3. Generate test token with JWT utilities
4. Apply role to target interface via WebSocket
5. Test functionality with different permissions in real-time

### Advanced Performance Profiling

2. Browse React component hierarchy
3. View render counts and performance metrics
4. Identify components with high re-render frequency
5. Get optimization suggestions for slow components

### Live Error Tracking
1. Debug Tools automatically captures all errors
2. View errors by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
3. Analyze stack traces and debugging context
4. Filter errors by component or time range
5. Get automated debugging suggestions

## Development Workflow

1. **Start Development**: Launch all interfaces using deployment script
2. **Monitor Status**: Use Developer Interface dashboard to monitor all services
3. **Test Features**: Switch between user roles to test different functionality
4. **Debug Issues**: Use built-in debugging tools and error reporting
5. **Performance Check**: Monitor metrics and optimize as needed

## Troubleshooting

### Interface Not Loading
- Check if target interface is running on expected port
- Verify nginx proxy configuration
- Check browser console for CORS or network errors

### Authentication Issues
- Verify JWT token generation and validation
- Check API endpoint connectivity
- Ensure proper role permissions are set

### Performance Issues
- Monitor build times and error counts
- Check network request performance
- Use performance metrics to identify bottlenecks

## Contributing

1. Follow existing code patterns and TypeScript conventions
2. Add tests for new features
3. Update documentation for any new functionality
4. Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
5. Test across different browsers and screen sizes
