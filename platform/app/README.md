# Therapeutic App Workspace (Placeholder)

This folder will eventually mirror the deployed therapeutic stack (API gateway, gameplay loop, safety components, etc.) once we finish carving the repo into `platform/app` vs. `platform/dev`. No files have been moved here yet — the directory simply reserves the namespace so scripts can start referencing it.
