# TTA Platform Directory

**Status:** Under investigation
**Created:** Unknown (likely git merge or parallel development)
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-09

## ⚠️ Important

This directory may be a duplicate or legacy artifact. The primary platform code is in:

**`~/repos/TTA.dev/platform/`** - The universal toolkit

## Investigation Needed

Before using or modifying code in this directory:

1. Compare with TTA.dev/platform/
2. Check if code is referenced in src/
3. Determine if this is:
   - A duplicate (should be deleted)
   - Game-specific platform code (should be renamed/documented)
   - Legacy code (should be archived)

## Recommendation

If this directory is not actively used, consider:
- Moving game-specific code to `src/`
- Deleting if duplicate of TTA.dev/platform/
- Archiving if historical reference only

## See Also
