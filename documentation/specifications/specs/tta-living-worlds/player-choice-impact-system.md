# Player Choice Impact System Specification

**Status**: ✅ OPERATIONAL **Player Choice Impact System Implemented** (2024-12-19)
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Implementation**: src/tta_living_worlds/choice_impact/
**Owner**: tta-dev-team@example.com
**Reviewer**: tta-dev-team@example.com

## Overview

The Player Choice Impact System implements comprehensive processing of player choices, consequence propagation, preference tracking, and therapeutic feedback within the TTA Living Worlds platform. This system provides clinical-grade choice impact analysis, world evolution guidance, and therapeutic consequence management to enhance player agency while maintaining therapeutic effectiveness and narrative coherence.

**Current Implementation Status**: ✅ **OPERATIONAL** (December 2024)

- Complete player choice processing with consequence propagation and preference tracking
- Therapeutic choice impact computation with clinical effectiveness analysis
- Comprehensive feedback system with choice impact visualization
- Integration with WorldStateManager and narrative branching systems
- Preference tracking with influence computation and world evolution guidance
- Production-ready choice impact system for therapeutic world interactions

The system serves as the comprehensive choice impact and consequence management platform for the TTA Living Worlds therapeutic environment.

## Purpose

Implements processing of player choices, consequence propagation, preference tracking, and feedback. Provides guidance for world evolution and exposes an integration entry point via WorldStateManager.

## Scope

- Choice ingestion via ChoiceOption and context
- PlayerChoice construction and validation
- ChoiceImpact computation (scope, strength, affected entities)
- ConsequencePropagation across characters, locations, and objects
- Preference tracking (PlayerPreferenceTracker) and influence computation
- Feedback via ChoiceImpactVisualizer
- Integration with WorldStateManager.process_player_choice
- Persistence of evolution_preference_bias for world evolution

## Data Flow

1. UI/backend passes a ChoiceOption + context to WorldStateManager.process_player_choice
2. WSM delegates to PlayerChoiceImpactSystem.process_player_choice
3. System constructs PlayerChoice, validates, computes initial ChoiceImpact
4. NarrativeBranching processes choice; result integrated into impact
5. ConsequencePropagation generates TimelineEvents across affected entities
6. PreferenceTracker updates category preferences and computes influence
7. Visualizer creates feedback summary
8. WSM stores evolution_preference_bias flag based on influence map
9. WSM persists world state

## Integration Contract

- Input: ChoiceOption, context including player_id, world_id, characters_present, current_location, objects_present, etc.
- Output: dict with success, impact summary, feedback, world_evolution_guidance, propagation event ids
- Side effects: Timeline events created; preference tracker updated; evolution_preference_bias set on world state

## Evolution Bias Application

- WorldStateManager.\_generate_time_period_events reads evolution_preference_bias
- Applies category-weighted multipliers to event generators:
  - Social/emotional/therapeutic -> social interactions
  - Exploration/creative/action -> environmental changes
  - Reflection -> daily life events
- Multiplier function maps [-1..1] bias to [0.5..1.5]

## Validation and Tests

- Unit: PlayerPreference thresholds and update logic; impact scope and strength
- Integration: WSM.process_player_choice creates timeline events; object propagation; bias flag set after repeated choices

## Open Questions / Future Work

- Tagging generated evolution events with content categories for stronger bias verification
- Persisting preference summaries across sessions via persistence layer
- Surfacing feedback visualization to UI layer with consistent schema
