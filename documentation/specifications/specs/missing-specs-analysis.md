## Notes

- Each spec should follow the established TTA spec format with requirements, design, and tasks documents
- All specs must prioritize therapeutic safety and user wellbeing
- Integration with existing TTA architecture and components is essential
- Consider multi-repository structure (tta.dev, tta.prototype, tta.prod) in all designs
