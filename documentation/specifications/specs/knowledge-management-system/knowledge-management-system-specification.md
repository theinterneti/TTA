# Knowledge Management System Specification

**Status**: ðŸš§ IN_PROGRESS **Infrastructure Ready, Implementation Planned** (2024-12-19)
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Implementation**: src/knowledge_management/
**Owner**: tta-dev-team@example.com
**Reviewer**: tta-dev-team@example.com

## Overview

The Knowledge Management System (KMS) serves as the central intelligence layer for the TTA platform, providing unified access to structured knowledge graphs and semantic search capabilities. The system combines Neo4j graph databases with vector embeddings to enable both relational and semantic knowledge operations, supporting therapeutic content delivery, narrative coherence, and cross-session user experience continuity.

**Current Implementation Status**: ðŸš§ **IN_PROGRESS** (December 2024)
- Neo4j graph database infrastructure operational
- Vector embedding service integration prepared
- Redis caching layer for performance optimization
- Component-based architecture following TTA patterns
- Integration points with therapeutic systems established

The KMS follows TTA's component-based architecture, integrating with existing infrastructure while providing a clean abstraction layer for knowledge operations across all system components.
