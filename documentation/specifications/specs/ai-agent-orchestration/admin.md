# Administrative Recovery Command Specification

**Status**: ✅ OPERATIONAL **Admin Recovery System Implemented** (2024-12-19)
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Implementation**: src/agent_orchestration/admin/
**Owner**: tta-dev-team@example.com
**Reviewer**: tta-dev-team@example.com

## Overview

A CLI utility is provided to manually trigger message recovery and display per-agent recovery statistics. The administrative recovery command provides comprehensive agent orchestration system management with manual recovery capabilities, statistics monitoring, and operational maintenance tools for production environments.

**Current Implementation Status**: ✅ **OPERATIONAL** (December 2024)

- Complete administrative recovery command implementation
- Manual message recovery and agent statistics monitoring
- Production-ready operational maintenance tools
- Safe multi-execution recovery with expired reservation reclamation
- Integration with Redis-based agent orchestration system
- Comprehensive recovery statistics and monitoring capabilities

The system serves as the operational maintenance and recovery management tool for the AI agent orchestration platform.

## Usage

```bash
uv run python -m src.agent_orchestration.admin.recover REDIS_URL --key-prefix ao
```

- Connects to Redis
- Executes `recover_pending(None)` logic per agent instance
- Prints recovered counts per agent type:instance and total

## Notes

- Uses the same key prefix as the orchestration system (default: `ao`)
- Safe to run multiple times; only expired reservations are reclaimed
