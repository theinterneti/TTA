# Coherence Validation System Specification

**Status**: ðŸš§ IN_PROGRESS **Validation Systems Integrated** (2024-12-19)
**Version**: 1.0.0
**Implementation**: src/coherence_validation/
**Owner**: tta-dev-team@example.com
**Reviewer**: tta-dev-team@example.com

## Overview

The Coherence Validation System ensures narrative consistency, therapeutic continuity, and logical coherence across all TTA platform interactions. This system provides real-time validation of narrative elements, character development, world state consistency, and therapeutic intervention alignment to maintain immersive and therapeutically effective experiences.

**Current Implementation Status**: ðŸš§ **IN_PROGRESS** (December 2024)
- Real-time narrative coherence validation operational
- Character development consistency tracking implemented
- World state validation with cross-session persistence
- Therapeutic intervention alignment monitoring
- Integration with knowledge management for coherence rules
- Performance optimization for sub-millisecond validation

The system serves as the quality assurance layer that maintains narrative and therapeutic integrity across all player interactions and system components.

## Implementation Status

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR-1: Narrative Coherence Validation**
- WHEN validating narrative consistency and logical flow
- THEN the system SHALL provide real-time narrative coherence assessment
- AND support cross-session narrative continuity validation
- AND enable automatic coherence issue detection and correction

**FR-2: Character Development Consistency**
- WHEN tracking character development and progression
- THEN the system SHALL provide character consistency validation
- AND support therapeutic alignment with character growth
- AND enable character development coherence across sessions

**FR-3: World State Validation**
- WHEN maintaining world state consistency and logic
- THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive world state validation
- AND support cross-component world state synchronization
- AND enable world logic consistency enforcement

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR-1: Performance**
- Response time: <100ms for coherence validation
- Throughput: Real-time validation for all platform interactions
- Resource constraints: Optimized for continuous validation processing

**NFR-2: Accuracy**
- Validation precision: High-accuracy coherence detection
- False positive rate: <5% for coherence issue identification
- Coverage: Comprehensive validation across all narrative elements
- Consistency: Reliable coherence rule enforcement

**NFR-3: Reliability**
- Availability: 99.9% uptime for validation services
- Scalability: Platform-wide coherence validation support
- Error handling: Graceful validation failure recovery
- Data integrity: Consistent coherence rule and validation state management

## Technical Design

### Architecture Description
Real-time coherence validation system with narrative consistency checking, character development tracking, and world state validation. Integrates with knowledge management and therapeutic systems to ensure comprehensive coherence across all TTA platform interactions.

### Component Interaction Details

- **NarrativeValidator**: Narrative consistency and logical flow validation
- **CharacterTracker**: Character development consistency and therapeutic alignment
- **WorldStateValidator**: World state consistency and logic enforcement
- **RuleEngine**: Coherence rule management and validation logic processing

### Data Flow Description
1. Real-time interaction and content validation processing
2. Narrative coherence assessment and consistency checking
3. Character development tracking and therapeutic alignment validation
4. World state consistency enforcement and synchronization
5. Coherence issue detection and automatic correction
6. Validation metrics collection and coherence analytics

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
