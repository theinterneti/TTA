# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Agent Orchestration System is a foundational component of the TTA (Therapeutic Text Adventure) platform that coordinates multiple specialized AI agents to deliver coherent, therapeutic, and engaging narrative experiences. This system manages the World Builder Agent (WBA), Input Processor Agent (IPA), and Narrative Generator Agent (NGA), orchestrating their interactions through sophisticated workflow management, dynamic tool integration, and performance optimization.

Building upon the existing TTA architecture with Neo4j knowledge graphs, LangGraph workflows, and the dynamic tool system, this orchestration layer ensures that multiple AI agents work together seamlessly to create personalized therapeutic experiences. The system must maintain therapeutic safety, optimize resource utilization on single-GPU constraints, and provide robust error handling while delivering real-time interactive experiences.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Agent Workflow Coordination

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want multiple AI agents to work together in coordinated workflows, so that complex therapeutic narrative tasks can be decomposed and handled by specialized agents working in harmony.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user interaction is received THEN the system SHALL route it through the appropriate agent workflow based on interaction type and context
2. WHEN agents need to collaborate THEN the system SHALL coordinate their execution order and data exchange according to predefined workflow patterns
3. WHEN an agent completes its task THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger dependent agents and pass relevant context and results
4. IF an agent workflow fails THEN the system SHALL implement fallback strategies and graceful degradation without breaking the user experience
5. WHEN multiple workflows run concurrently THEN the system SHALL manage resource allocation and prevent conflicts between agent operations

### Requirement 2: Agent Communication and Message Passing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want agents to communicate through well-defined protocols, so that they can share context, coordinate actions, and maintain consistency across the therapeutic experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents need to exchange information THEN the system SHALL use structured message formats with clear schemas and validation
2. WHEN an agent sends a message THEN the system SHALL ensure reliable delivery and provide acknowledgment mechanisms
3. WHEN message queues become full THEN the system SHALL implement backpressure and priority-based message handling
4. IF message delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and alert administrators of persistent failures
5. WHEN agents share context THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency and prevent race conditions in shared state

### Requirement 3: Dynamic Tool System Integration

**User Story:** As an AI agent, I want access to dynamically generated tools that match my current task requirements, so that I can perform specialized operations efficiently and accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent requires a tool THEN the system SHALL dynamically generate or retrieve the appropriate tool based on current context and task requirements
2. WHEN tools are generated THEN the system SHALL validate their safety, therapeutic appropriateness, and integration compatibility
3. WHEN multiple agents need similar tools THEN the system SHALL optimize tool sharing and prevent redundant tool generation
4. IF tool generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback tools or alternative approaches to complete the task
5. WHEN tools are no longer needed THEN the system SHALL clean up resources and update tool registries appropriately

### Requirement 4: Performance Monitoring and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor agent performance and resource utilization, so that I can ensure optimal system performance and identify bottlenecks or issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents are executing THEN the system SHALL track performance metrics including response times, resource usage, and success rates
2. WHEN resource constraints are detected THEN the system SHALL implement load balancing and resource allocation strategies
3. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust agent priorities and resource allocation to maintain service quality
4. IF critical performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and implement emergency resource management
5. WHEN generating performance reports THEN the system SHALL provide actionable insights for system optimization and capacity planning

### Requirement 5: Therapeutic Safety and Content Validation

**User Story:** As a therapeutic content supervisor, I want all agent outputs to be validated for therapeutic appropriateness, so that users receive safe and beneficial therapeutic experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents generate content THEN the system SHALL validate it against therapeutic safety guidelines and content appropriateness standards
2. WHEN potentially harmful content is detected THEN the system SHALL block it and request alternative content generation from the responsible agent
3. WHEN therapeutic interventions are coordinated THEN the system SHALL ensure they align with established therapeutic frameworks and user readiness levels
4. IF safety validation fails repeatedly THEN the system SHALL escalate to human oversight and implement protective measures
5. WHEN therapeutic progress is tracked THEN the system SHALL coordinate agent activities to support consistent therapeutic goals

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Fault Tolerance

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to continue providing therapeutic support even when individual agents encounter errors, so that my therapeutic experience remains uninterrupted and beneficial.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent encounters an error THEN the system SHALL isolate the failure and prevent it from cascading to other agents
2. WHEN critical agents fail THEN the system SHALL activate backup agents or alternative workflows to maintain service continuity
3. WHEN errors are detected THEN the system SHALL log detailed diagnostic information and attempt automatic recovery procedures
4. IF automatic recovery fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade functionality while maintaining therapeutic safety
5. WHEN system stability is restored THEN the system SHALL resume full functionality and update users on service status

### Requirement 7: Real-time Interaction Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want responsive interactions with the therapeutic system, so that I can engage naturally in conversations and activities without noticeable delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends input THEN the system SHALL coordinate agent responses to deliver output within 2 seconds for standard interactions
2. WHEN complex processing is required THEN the system SHALL provide progressive feedback and status updates to maintain user engagement
3. WHEN multiple users interact simultaneously THEN the system SHALL manage concurrent agent workflows without performance degradation
4. IF response times exceed acceptable limits THEN the system SHALL implement optimization strategies and inform users of processing status
5. WHEN real-time features are used THEN the system SHALL maintain WebSocket connections and handle connection failures gracefully

### Requirement 8: Configuration and Extensibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure agent behaviors and extend the orchestration system with new agents, so that the platform can evolve and adapt to new therapeutic approaches and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new agents are added THEN the system SHALL automatically discover and integrate them into existing workflows
2. WHEN agent configurations change THEN the system SHALL apply updates without requiring system restarts or service interruptions
3. WHEN workflow patterns are modified THEN the system SHALL validate changes and update agent coordination accordingly
4. IF configuration errors are detected THEN the system SHALL prevent invalid configurations and provide clear error messages
5. WHEN system extensions are deployed THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility and provide migration support for existing workflows
