## Overview

The API Gateway & Service Integration system serves as the unified entry point for all TTA (Therapeutic Text Adventure) services, providing centralized routing, authentication, rate limiting, and service discovery. This system has evolved to implement a **direct integration approach** that streamlines service communication while maintaining therapeutic safety standards and clinical compliance requirements.

**Current Implementation Status**: ✅ **OPERATIONAL** (December 2024)

- **Direct Integration Approach**: Simplified architecture with direct service-to-service communication
- Integrated with TTA Shared Component Library for authentication and compliance
- HIPAA-compliant audit logging and session management
- Real-time WebSocket support for crisis monitoring and therapeutic sessions
- Clinical-grade performance with <1s response time for critical operations

The gateway implements a high-performance, containerized service that integrates seamlessly with the existing TTA infrastructure while maintaining therapeutic safety standards and clinical compliance requirements through direct integration patterns rather than complex routing layers.

    endpoints: List[str]
    health_check_url: str
    dependencies: List[str]
    therapeutic_priority: int

@dataclass
class AuthContext:

class TherapeuticEvent:
    event_type: str
    severity: str
    user_id: str
    content: str
    timestamp: datetime
    requires_escalation: bool
```

### Database Schema

The gateway will use Redis for session storage and caching, with the following key patterns:

- **Service Registry**: `services:{service_name}` → ServiceInfo
- **Health Status**: `health:{service_id}` → HealthStatus
- **Rate Limits**: `ratelimit:{user_id}:{endpoint}` → RateLimitCounter
- **Session Data**: `session:{session_id}` → SessionState
- **Cache Data**: `cache:{cache_key}` → CachedResponse

## Error Handling

### Error Classification and Response Strategy

1. **Client Errors (4xx)**:

   - Authentication failures → 401 with therapeutic-safe error messages
   - Authorization failures → 403 with role-specific guidance
   - Rate limiting → 429 with retry-after headers
   - Validation errors → 400 with detailed field-level feedback

2. **Server Errors (5xx)**:

   - Service unavailable → 503 with circuit breaker status
   - Gateway timeout → 504 with retry recommendations
   - Internal errors → 500 with correlation IDs for tracking

3. **Therapeutic Safety Errors**:
   - Content safety violations → Custom 422 with safety guidance
   - Crisis detection → Immediate escalation with 202 acknowledgment
   - Privacy violations → 451 with compliance information

### Circuit Breaker Implementation

```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold: int = 5, timeout: int = 60):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.state = "CLOSED"  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
```

**Design Rationale**: Circuit breakers prevent cascade failures and provide graceful degradation when backend services become unavailable, which is critical for maintaining therapeutic session continuity.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Approach

1. **Component Isolation**: Each gateway component will have comprehensive unit tests with mocked dependencies
2. **Authentication Testing**: JWT validation, role-based access control, and token refresh scenarios
3. **Rate Limiting Testing**: Various traffic patterns, burst handling, and therapeutic prioritization
4. **WebSocket Testing**: Connection lifecycle, message routing, and session state management

### Integration Testing Strategy

1. **Service Discovery Integration**: Test with actual service registration and health check scenarios
2. **End-to-End Request Flow**: Complete request routing through all gateway components
3. **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time communication with multiple concurrent connections
4. **Security Integration**: Content scanning, safety protocols, and audit logging

### Load Testing Requirements

1. **Performance Benchmarks**:

   - Target: 10,000 concurrent connections
   - Response time: <100ms for cached responses, <500ms for proxied requests
   - Throughput: 50,000 requests per minute sustained

2. **Therapeutic Load Patterns**:
   - Simulate therapeutic session bursts
   - Test WebSocket scaling with multiple concurrent sessions
   - Validate rate limiting under various user behavior patterns

### Security Testing

1. **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments focusing on therapeutic data protection
2. **Content Safety Testing**: Validate therapeutic content scanning and safety protocols
3. **Compliance Testing**: Ensure HIPAA and therapeutic privacy requirements are met

## Implementation Considerations

### Deployment Architecture

The API Gateway will be deployed as a containerized service with the following characteristics:

1. **High Availability**: Multiple gateway instances behind a load balancer
2. **Horizontal Scaling**: Auto-scaling based on CPU, memory, and connection metrics
3. **Health Monitoring**: Kubernetes health checks and readiness probes
4. **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration with the existing `config/tta_config.yaml` system

### Integration with Existing TTA Infrastructure

2. **Service Discovery**: Integrate with existing component discovery mechanisms
3. **Authentication**: Leverage existing TTA authentication systems and user management
4. **Monitoring**: Integrate with existing logging and monitoring infrastructure

### Performance Optimization Strategies

1. **Connection Pooling**: Maintain persistent connections to backend services
2. **Response Caching**: Intelligent caching of therapeutic content and user data
3. **Request Batching**: Aggregate multiple requests where therapeutically appropriate
4. **Async Processing**: Full async/await implementation for maximum concurrency

### Security Implementation Details

1. **TLS Termination**: Handle SSL/TLS at the gateway level with certificate management
2. **Header Security**: Implement OWASP security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
3. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive request validation and sanitization
4. **Audit Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs for therapeutic compliance

**Design Rationale**: This architecture provides a scalable, secure, and therapeutically-aware API gateway that can grow with the TTA platform while maintaining the highest standards for user safety and clinical compliance. The modular design allows for independent scaling and updates of different gateway components while preserving system stability.
