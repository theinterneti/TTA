### Requirement 4: Clinical Documentation and Notes

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want to maintain clinical notes and documentation within the therapeutic system, so that I can track patient progress and maintain comprehensive clinical records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating clinical notes THEN the system SHALL provide structured templates for therapeutic documentation
2. WHEN saving clinical documentation THEN the system SHALL maintain version history and audit trails
3. WHEN accessing historical notes THEN the system SHALL provide chronological views of patient therapeutic journey
4. IF clinical notes contain sensitive information THEN the system SHALL implement additional access controls and encryption
5. WHEN sharing clinical information THEN the system SHALL comply with HIPAA sharing requirements and patient consent

**Implementation Status**: ðŸ“‹ **PHASE 3 PLANNED**
- **Clinical Notes Interface**: Structured documentation templates
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Secure storage and access controls for clinical documentation
- **Integration**: Connection with existing clinical record systems (planned)

### Requirement 5: Healthcare Provider Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a healthcare provider, I want secure authentication that verifies my clinical credentials, so that I can access patient information appropriate to my role and responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logging in THEN the system SHALL verify healthcare provider credentials and license status
2. WHEN accessing patient data THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based permissions based on clinical relationship
3. WHEN authentication expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication without losing clinical context
4. IF suspicious access patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL require additional verification and alert administrators
