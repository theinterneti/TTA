## 🚧 Integration Challenge Identified

### Issue: Branch History Divergence
- Recovery branch created from older main branch version
- Current main branch has evolved significantly
- No common ancestor prevents direct PR creation
- Hundreds of merge conflicts in core files

### Affected Systems
- Agent orchestration (both branches have implementations)
- Player experience (overlapping approaches)
- Configuration management (different setups)
- Testing infrastructure (conflicting structures)
- Documentation (different organization)

## 🎯 Next Steps: Integration Planning

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Technical Review Meeting** - Assess both codebases
2. **Integration Strategy Decision** - Choose approach
3. **Resource Allocation** - Assign team members
4. **Timeline Planning** - Adjust project milestones

### Integration Options
- **Option A**: Cherry-Pick Approach (2-3 weeks, Medium risk)
- **Option B**: Parallel Development (4-6 weeks, Low risk)
- **Option C**: Fresh Integration Branch (3-4 weeks, Medium risk)
