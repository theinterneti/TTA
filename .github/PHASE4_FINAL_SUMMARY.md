## 📦 Deliverables

### 5 New Chat Mode Files Created

**Tier 1: CRITICAL** (Unblocks Production)
1. ✅ `devops-engineer.chatmode.md` - Deployment, CI/CD, infrastructure
2. ✅ `qa-engineer.chatmode.md` - Testing, quality assurance, coverage
3. ✅ `api-gateway-engineer.chatmode.md` - API design, auth, security

**Tier 2: HIGH** (Core Features)
4. ✅ `narrative-engine-developer.chatmode.md` - Story design, generation
5. ✅ `therapeutic-content-creator.chatmode.md` - Content design, safety

### Supporting Documentation
- ✅ `PHASE4_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed completion report
- ✅ `PHASE4_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md` - Review and validation summary
- ✅ Updated `AGENT_PRIMITIVE_MIGRATION_STATUS.md` - Migration status

## 📊 Coverage Achievement

### Before Phase 4
- **Coverage**: 60% (6/10 tasks)
- **Gaps**: DevOps, QA, API Gateway, Narrative, Therapeutic Content

### After Phase 4
- **Coverage**: 100% (10/10 tasks)
- **All gaps filled**: ✅ Complete TTA development coverage

## 🔒 Security & Quality

### MCP Tool Boundaries
- **ALLOWED Tools**: 25+ definitions
- **RESTRICTED Tools**: 15+ definitions
- **DENIED Tools**: 20+ definitions
- **Total Boundaries**: 60+ tool definitions

### File Pattern Restrictions
- **Read/Write Patterns**: 30+ patterns
- **Read-Only Patterns**: 15+ patterns
- **Denied Patterns**: 20+ patterns
- **Total Patterns**: 65+ patterns

### Approval Gates
- ✅ Production deployment requires explicit approval
- ✅ File deletion requires approval
- ✅ Database operations require approval
- ✅ HIPAA compliance enforced
