## Overview
Set up completely separate production database instances with hard resource isolation, distinct from development/staging environments.

## Context
Currently using simplified single-instance approach for MVP development (see MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md). This works great for:
- âœ… Local development with logical separation via databases/DB numbers
- âœ… Reduced complexity and resource usage
- âœ… Cleaner AI agent context

However, **production requires physical separation** for:
- ðŸ”’ Security isolation
- ðŸ’ª Resource guarantees
- ðŸ“Š Independent monitoring
- ðŸ”„ Zero-downtime deployments

## Requirements

### Neo4j Production Instance
- [ ] Separate physical/virtual machine or container orchestration namespace
- [ ] Production-grade hardware allocation (minimum 8GB RAM, 4 CPU cores)
- [ ] Encrypted connections (TLS/SSL)
- [ ] Automated backups (daily full, hourly incremental)
- [ ] Separate credentials from dev/staging
- [ ] Production-specific plugins and configuration
- [ ] Point-in-time recovery capability
- [ ] Read replicas for scaling (future)

### Redis Production Instance
- [ ] Separate instance with persistence enabled
- [ ] Production-grade hardware allocation (minimum 4GB RAM)
- [ ] Redis Sentinel or Redis Cluster for HA
- [ ] Automated backups (RDB + AOF)
- [ ] Separate credentials from dev/staging
- [ ] Connection pooling configuration
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Kubernetes namespace OR separate VMs/servers
- [ ] Network isolation (VPC, security groups)
- [ ] Firewall rules (whitelist only necessary services)
- [ ] Load balancer configuration
- [ ] SSL certificate management
- [ ] Secret management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Prometheus metrics collection
- [ ] Grafana dashboards for production
- [ ] Alert rules for critical issues
- [ ] Log aggregation (ELK, Loki, CloudWatch)
- [ ] Performance tracking
- [ ] Cost monitoring

### Deployment
- [ ] Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform, Pulumi)
- [ ] Automated deployment pipeline
- [ ] Blue/green deployment support
- [ ] Rollback procedures
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Planning
- [ ] Define resource requirements based on expected load
- [ ] Choose deployment platform (AWS, GCP, Azure, self-hosted)
- [ ] Design network architecture
- [ ] Plan backup and recovery procedures

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] Provision production servers/containers
- [ ] Configure networking and security
- [ ] Set up monitoring infrastructure
- [ ] Implement backup systems

### Phase 3: Database Deployment
- [ ] Deploy Neo4j production instance
- [ ] Deploy Redis production instance
- [ ] Configure replication/HA if needed
- [ ] Validate performance

### Phase 4: Integration
- [ ] Update application configuration for production
- [ ] Test connection from application
- [ ] Migrate initial data
- [ ] Validate all integrations

### Phase 5: Operations
- [ ] Document runbooks
- [ ] Set up alerting
- [ ] Train team on production procedures
- [ ] Establish SLAs

## Example Configuration

```yaml
# docker-compose.production.yml (or Kubernetes deployment)
version: '3.8'

services:
  neo4j-production:
    image: neo4j:5.26.1-enterprise  # Enterprise for production features
    container_name: tta-neo4j-production
    ports:
      - "7687:7687"  # Only accessible via internal network
    environment:
      - NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/${NEO4J_PRODUCTION_PASSWORD}
      - NEO4J_dbms_memory_heap_initial__size=4G
      - NEO4J_dbms_memory_heap_max__size=8G
      - NEO4J_dbms_memory_pagecache_size=4G
      # Production-specific settings
      - NEO4J_dbms_backup_enabled=true
      - NEO4J_dbms_backup_address=0.0.0.0:6362
    volumes:
      - neo4j_production_data:/data
      - neo4j_production_logs:/logs
      - neo4j_production_backups:/backups
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '4'
          memory: 12G
        reservations:
          cpus: '2'
          memory: 8G
    restart: always

  redis-production:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    container_name: tta-redis-production
    command: >
      redis-server
      --requirepass ${REDIS_PRODUCTION_PASSWORD}
      --maxmemory 4gb
      --maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
      --appendonly yes
      --save 900 1
      --save 300 10
      --save 60 10000
    volumes:
      - redis_production_data:/data
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '2'
          memory: 4G
        reservations:
          cpus: '1'
          memory: 2G
    restart: always
```
