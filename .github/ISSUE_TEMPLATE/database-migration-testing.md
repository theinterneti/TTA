## Overview
Set up capability to run multiple Neo4j versions simultaneously for testing database upgrades, ensuring smooth migration paths and backward compatibility.

## Context
Currently using Neo4j 5.26.1. As Neo4j releases new versions (6.x, 7.x), we need to:
- ✅ Test migrations before upgrading production
- ✅ Validate data integrity during upgrades
- ✅ Ensure application compatibility with new versions
- ✅ Support blue/green deployments

## Problem Statement
Database upgrades are risky without proper testing:
- ❌ Unknown breaking changes in new versions
- ❌ Data migration failures
- ❌ Application compatibility issues
- ❌ Downtime during upgrades

## Solution: Multi-Version Testing Environment

### Approach
Run multiple Neo4j versions side-by-side:
1. **Current version** (5.26.1) - Production baseline
2. **Next version** (6.x) - Upgrade target
3. **Migration pipeline** - Data sync and validation

## Requirements

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Docker Compose setup for multi-version Neo4j
- [ ] Separate ports for each version
- [ ] Volume management for data migration testing
- [ ] Network isolation between versions

### Migration Tools
- [ ] Neo4j migration scripts
- [ ] Data validation scripts
- [ ] Schema comparison tools
- [ ] Rollback procedures

### Testing
- [ ] Application compatibility tests against new version
- [ ] Data integrity validation
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Breaking change detection

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Multi-Version Setup
```yaml
# docker-compose.migration-test.yml
version: '3.8'

services:
  # Current production version
  neo4j-current:
    image: neo4j:5.26.1-community
    container_name: tta-neo4j-5x
    ports:
      - "7474:7474"
      - "7687:7687"
    environment:
      - NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password
    volumes:
      - neo4j_5x_data:/data
    networks:
      - migration-test

  # Next version for testing
  neo4j-next:
    image: neo4j:6.0.0-community  # Example: Next major version
    container_name: tta-neo4j-6x
    ports:
      - "7475:7474"
      - "7688:7687"
    environment:
      - NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password
    volumes:
      - neo4j_6x_data:/data
    networks:
      - migration-test

volumes:
  neo4j_5x_data:
  neo4j_6x_data:

networks:
  migration-test:
```

### Phase 2: Migration Scripts
```python
# scripts/test_neo4j_migration.py
"""Test Neo4j version migration"""

from neo4j import GraphDatabase
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class Neo4jMigrationTester:
    def __init__(self):
        self.old_uri = "bolt://localhost:7687"
        self.new_uri = "bolt://localhost:7688"
        self.auth = ("neo4j", "password")

    def export_from_old_version(self):
        """Export data from current version"""
        driver = GraphDatabase.driver(self.old_uri, auth=self.auth)
        # Export logic
        driver.close()

    def import_to_new_version(self):
        """Import data to new version"""
        driver = GraphDatabase.driver(self.new_uri, auth=self.auth)
        # Import logic
        driver.close()

    def validate_data_integrity(self):
        """Compare data between versions"""
        # Validation logic
        pass

    def test_application_compatibility(self):
        """Test app against new version"""
        # Run test suite against new version
        pass
```

### Phase 3: Automated Migration Testing
```bash
# scripts/run_migration_test.sh
#!/bin/bash

echo "Starting migration test..."

# 1. Start both versions
docker-compose -f docker-compose.migration-test.yml up -d

# 2. Populate old version with test data
python scripts/populate_test_data.py --version 5

# 3. Export from old version
python scripts/export_neo4j_data.py --source bolt://localhost:7687

# 4. Import to new version
python scripts/import_neo4j_data.py --target bolt://localhost:7688

# 5. Validate data integrity
python scripts/validate_migration.py

# 6. Run compatibility tests
pytest tests/migration/ --neo4j-uri bolt://localhost:7688

# 7. Cleanup
docker-compose -f docker-compose.migration-test.yml down
```

### Phase 4: Blue/Green Deployment Support
- [ ] Load balancer configuration
- [ ] Traffic switching capability
- [ ] Gradual rollout strategy
- [ ] Automatic rollback on errors

## Migration Validation Checklist

### Data Integrity
- [ ] Node count matches (old vs new)
- [ ] Relationship count matches
- [ ] Property values preserved
- [ ] Indexes migrated correctly
- [ ] Constraints maintained

### Performance
- [ ] Query performance comparable or better
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Resource usage acceptable
- [ ] Concurrent access works

### Application Compatibility
- [ ] All queries work on new version
- [ ] No breaking API changes
- [ ] Authentication still works
- [ ] Plugins compatible
- [ ] Custom procedures work

### Rollback Capability
- [ ] Can restore from backup
- [ ] Downgrade procedure documented
- [ ] Data loss acceptable/minimal
- [ ] Rollback tested successfully

## Example Migration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Minor Version Upgrade (5.26 → 5.27)
- Low risk
- Usually backward compatible
- Test in staging first
- Quick rollback if needed

### Scenario 2: Major Version Upgrade (5.x → 6.x)
- Higher risk
- Potential breaking changes
- Extensive testing required
- Blue/green deployment recommended

### Scenario 3: Breaking Change Migration
- Review changelog thoroughly
- Update application code if needed
- Staged rollout
- Monitor closely

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Can run multiple Neo4j versions simultaneously
- [ ] Migration scripts automated and tested
- [ ] Data validation passes 100%
- [ ] Zero application errors on new version
- [ ] Rollback procedure tested and verified
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Dependencies
- Docker Compose for multi-container setup
- Neo4j admin tools for dump/load
- Automated testing infrastructure
