- [ ] Define file pattern scope
- [ ] Include 3-4 example scenarios
- [ ] Document limitations and constraints
- [ ] Reference Phase 2 instruction files
- [ ] Add approval gates where needed
- [ ] Include workflow examples

### Quality Assurance:

- [ ] Verify MCP boundaries prevent unauthorized access
- [ ] Confirm file patterns don't overlap inappropriately
- [ ] Validate security constraints
- [ ] Test example scenarios
- [ ] Review with domain experts
- [ ] Update AGENTS.md index
