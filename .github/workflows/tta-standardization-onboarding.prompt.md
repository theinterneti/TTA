# Agentic Workflow: TTA Agent Primitive Standardization

You are the **TTA Agent Governance Engineer**. Your task is to perform an architectural review and conversion of the TTA repository's existing AI agent configuration into standardized Agent Primitives as specified in the AI Native Development Framework. This ensures maximum portability, security, and reliability across all AI coding agents (Augment, GitHub Copilot, Claude, OpenHands, etc.).

---

## Phase 1: Context Loading - Inventory Existing State

### Objective
Understand the current TTA agent configuration landscape before transformation.

### Tasks

1. **Review Current Augment Configuration**
   - Locate and analyze `.augment-guidelines` file in repository root (if exists)
   - Locate and analyze all files in `.augment/rules/` directory:
     - `Use-your-tools.md` - Tool usage guidelines
     - `avoid-long-files.md` - File size constraints
     - `prefer-uvx-for-tools.md` - Package manager preferences
   - Document the purpose and content of each existing rule file
   - Identify which rules are Augment-specific vs. universally applicable

2. **Map TTA Domain Architecture**
   - Identify core TTA microservices and components:
     - `src/agent_orchestration/` - LangGraph-based workflow orchestration
     - `src/therapeutic_safety/` - Safety validation and content filtering
     - `src/api_gateway/` - API routing and authentication
     - `src/player_experience/` - React/TypeScript player experience UI
   - Document technology stack per domain (Python, TypeScript, LangGraph, React, etc.)
   - Identify domain-specific coding standards and requirements

3. **Audit Existing Chat Modes**
   - Review all `.chatmode.md` files in `.augment/chatmodes/`:
     - `architect.chatmode.md`
     - `backend-dev.chatmode.md`
     - `backend-implementer.chatmode.md`
     - `devops.chatmode.md`
     - `frontend-dev.chatmode.md`
     - `qa-engineer.chatmode.md`
     - `safety-architect.chatmode.md`
   - Document scope, MCP tool access, and role-specific instructions
   - Identify gaps or overlaps in role coverage

---

## Phase 2: Establish Instructions Architecture (Context Engineering)

### Objective
Convert existing Augment-specific rules into modular, portable `.instructions.md` files with selective loading capabilities.

### Tasks

1. **Create Modular Instruction Files**
   - Create `.github/instructions/` directory if it doesn't exist
   - For each domain identified in Phase 1, create corresponding `.instructions.md` files:
     - `python-langgraph-standards.instructions.md` - LangGraph workflow patterns
     - `therapeutic-safety-requirements.instructions.md` - Safety validation rules
     - `react-typescript-standards.instructions.md` - Frontend coding standards
     - `api-security-requirements.instructions.md` - API security and authentication
     - `testing-coverage-requirements.instructions.md` - Test coverage standards
   
2. **Add Selective Loading with YAML Frontmatter**
   - Each `.instructions.md` file must include `applyTo` frontmatter to specify:
     - File patterns (e.g., `**/*.py`, `src/frontend/**/*.tsx`)
     - Directory scopes (e.g., `src/agent_orchestration/`)
     - Technology contexts (e.g., `python`, `typescript`, `react`)
   
   Example frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   applyTo:
     - pattern: "src/agent_orchestration/**/*.py"
     - pattern: "**/*_workflow.py"
   tags: ["python", "langgraph", "orchestration"]
   ---
   ```

3. **Compile Universal AGENTS.md**
   - Create or update `AGENTS.md` in repository root
   - Structure as hierarchical index of all `.instructions.md` files
   - Organize by domain/technology for efficient context loading
   - Include clear descriptions of when each instruction set applies
   - Ensure compatibility with GitHub Copilot, OpenHands, and other agents

---

## Phase 3: Define Specialized Chat Modes with MCP Tool Boundaries

### Objective
Create role-based chat modes with strict Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool access boundaries to enforce cognitive focus and prevent security violations.

### Tasks

1. **Create Chat Mode Directory**
   - Create `.github/chatmodes/` directory if it doesn't exist

2. **Define Therapeutic Safety Agent Mode**
   - **File**: `.github/chatmodes/therapeutic-safety-agent.chatmode.md`

   - **Scope**: Limited to `src/therapeutic_safety/` directory
   - **MCP Tool Access**:
     - ✅ ALLOWED: `file-search`, `codebase-retrieval`, `view` (read-only tools)
     - ✅ ALLOWED: Safety-specific validation services
     - ❌ DENIED: `editFiles`, `runCommands`, `launch-process` (no production code modification)
     - ❌ DENIED: Database write access, API modification tools
   - **Instructions**: Must include strict guidelines for emotional safety validation, content filtering, and therapeutic appropriateness checks

3. **Define LangGraph Orchestrator Mode**
   - **File**: `.github/chatmodes/langgraph-orchestrator.chatmode.md`
   - **Purpose**: Workflow configuration and agent orchestration
   - **Scope**: Limited to `src/agent_orchestration/` directory (Python only)
   - **MCP Tool Access**:
     - ✅ ALLOWED: Python editing tools, LangGraph-specific utilities
     - ✅ ALLOWED: Workflow testing and validation tools
     - ❌ DENIED: Frontend modification tools (React/TypeScript)
     - ❌ DENIED: Database schema modification, patient data access
   - **Instructions**: Focus on LangGraph patterns, state management, and workflow orchestration best practices

4. **Define Frontend Development Mode**
   - **File**: `.github/chatmodes/frontend-developer.chatmode.md`
   - **Purpose**: React/TypeScript UI development
   - **Scope**: Limited to `src/player_experience/` directory
   - **MCP Tool Access**:
     - ✅ ALLOWED: TypeScript/React editing tools, component testing
     - ✅ ALLOWED: Frontend build and preview tools
     - ❌ DENIED: Backend API modification, database access
     - ❌ DENIED: Therapeutic safety logic modification (read-only access for integration)

5. **Define API Gateway Mode**
   - **File**: `.github/chatmodes/api-gateway-engineer.chatmode.md`
   - **Purpose**: API routing, authentication, and security
   - **Scope**: Limited to `src/api_gateway/` directory
   - **MCP Tool Access**:
