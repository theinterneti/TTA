# Chat Mode Analysis: Executive Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-27  
**Status**: Analysis Complete - Ready for Phase 4 Implementation  
**Prepared by**: TTA Agent Primitive Migrator

---

## Key Findings

### Current State
- **6 existing chat modes** across 2 locations
- **4 new universal modes** (Phase 3 deliverables) ✅
- **7 Augment-specific modes** (legacy) ⚠️
- **Coverage**: 60% of TTA development scenarios

### Critical Gaps
- ❌ **DevOps/Deployment** - Blocks production releases
- ❌ **QA/Testing** - Blocks quality assurance
- ❌ **API Gateway** - Blocks API development
- ❌ **Narrative Engine** - Blocks story creation
- ❌ **Therapeutic Content** - Blocks intervention design

## Part 1: Existing Chat Modes Assessment

### New Universal Modes (Phase 3) ✅

| Mode | Status | MCP Boundaries | Practical Fit |
|------|--------|----------------|---------------|
| Therapeutic Safety Auditor | ✅ EXCELLENT | ✅ Appropriate | ✅ Read-only compliance |
| LangGraph Engineer | ✅ EXCELLENT | ✅ Appropriate | ✅ Full orchestration dev |
| Database Admin | ✅ EXCELLENT | ✅ Appropriate | ✅ Schema + approval gates |
| Frontend Developer | ✅ EXCELLENT | ✅ Appropriate | ✅ Full UI development |

**Assessment**: All 4 modes are well-designed with appropriate MCP boundaries and practical utility.

### Legacy Augment Modes ⚠️

| Mode | Coverage | Overlap | Status |
|------|----------|---------|--------|
| Architect | Partial | LangGraph Engineer | Deprecate |
| Backend Developer | Partial | LangGraph + Database | Deprecate |
| Backend Implementer | Partial | LangGraph + Database | Deprecate |
| DevOps Engineer | ❌ MISSING | None | **CRITICAL** |
| QA Engineer | ❌ MISSING | None | **CRITICAL** |
| Safety Architect | Partial | Therapeutic Safety Auditor | Deprecate |
| Frontend Developer | ✅ COVERED | Frontend Developer | Migrate |

## Part 2: Sub-Agent Delegation Strategy

### When to Delegate

**Optimal Delegation Scenarios**:

1. **Long-running tasks** (> 30 minutes)
   - Example: Full test suite with coverage analysis
   - Delegate to: QA Engineer mode
   - Benefit: Non-blocking execution

2. **Specialized domain work**
   - Example: Orchestration workflow refactoring
   - Delegate to: LangGraph Engineer mode
   - Benefit: Deep domain expertise

3. **Parallel independent tasks**
   - Example: Tests + Documentation simultaneously
   - Delegate to: QA Engineer + Architect (parallel)
   - Benefit: Faster completion

4. **Production operations**
   - Example: Schema migration to production
   - Delegate to: Database Admin mode
   - Benefit: Approval gates ensure safety

### Handoff Protocol

```
Primary Agent → Sub-Agent Instruction:
1. Specify chat mode to assume
2. Define task scope and deliverables
3. Set approval requirements
4. Specify reporting format
5. Define reconvene conditions
```

### Example Delegation

```
"Delegate to OpenHands (QA Engineer mode):
'Analyze src/agent_orchestration/ and create 
comprehensive unit tests targeting 70% coverage. 
Use pytest-asyncio for async tests. Report 
coverage metrics and create PR.'"
```

## Part 3: Gap Analysis

### TTA Architecture Coverage

| Domain | Current | Status | Priority |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|
| Therapeutic Safety | ✅ Auditor | Covered | - |
| Agent Orchestration | ✅ LangGraph | Covered | - |
| Player Experience | ✅ Frontend | Covered | - |
| API Gateway | ⚠️ Partial | **MISSING** | CRITICAL |
| Narrative Engine | ❌ None | **MISSING** | HIGH |

### Missing Chat Modes (Priority Order)

#### Tier 1: CRITICAL (Implement Immediately)

1. **DevOps Engineer** (2-3 hours)
   - Deployment, CI/CD, infrastructure
   - Blocks: Production releases
   - MCP: Full infrastructure access

2. **QA Engineer** (2-3 hours)
   - Testing, coverage, quality
   - Blocks: Quality assurance
   - MCP: Full test access

3. **API Gateway Engineer** (2-3 hours)
   - API design, auth, security
   - Blocks: API development
   - MCP: API code + security

#### Tier 2: HIGH (Implement Next Sprint)

4. **Narrative Engine Developer** (2-3 hours)
   - Story design, coherence
   - Blocks: Narrative creation
   - MCP: Narrative code access

5. **Therapeutic Content Creator** (2-3 hours)
   - Intervention design, validation
   - Blocks: Content creation
   - MCP: Content + read-only safety

## Part 4: Completeness Assessment

### Coverage Matrix

**Current Coverage**: 60% (6/10 tasks)
**Gap Coverage**: 40% (4/10 tasks)

| Task | Coverage |
|------|----------|
| Design safety system | ✅ |
| Implement orchestration | ✅ |
| Manage database | ✅ |
| Build UI components | ✅ |
| Deploy to production | ❌ |
| Write tests | ❌ |
| Create narratives | ❌ |
| Design API endpoints | ❌ |
| Create therapeutic content | ❌ |
| Optimize performance | ⚠️ |

### Priority Recommendations

**Immediate (Phase 4)**:
1. DevOps Engineer - Unblocks production
2. QA Engineer - Unblocks quality
3. API Gateway Engineer - Unblocks API dev

**Next Sprint**:
4. Narrative Engine Developer - Core feature
5. Therapeutic Content Creator - Core feature

**Future**:
6. Performance Engineer - Optimization
7. Security Engineer - Security focus

## Integration Strategy

### Phase 4: Create 5 Missing Modes
- Create `.github/chatmodes/{mode}.chatmode.md` files
- Reference Phase 2 instruction files
- Define MCP tool boundaries
- Include example scenarios
- Estimated: 14-21 hours

### Phase 5: Human Validation
- Review all 11 chat modes
- Verify MCP boundaries
- Approve security constraints
- Estimated: 4-6 hours

### Phase 6: Commit and Document
- Deprecate Augment-specific modes
- Create migration guide
- Update AGENTS.md index
- Onboard team
- Estimated: 4-6 hours
