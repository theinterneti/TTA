## Part 2: Sub-Agent Delegation Strategy

### 2.1 When to Delegate

**Delegate to OpenHands with Specific Chat Mode When**:

1. **Long-running tasks** (> 30 minutes)
   - Example: "Run full test suite with coverage analysis"
   - Delegate to: QA Engineer mode
   - Reason: Prevents blocking primary agent

2. **Specialized domain work** requiring deep focus
   - Example: "Refactor orchestration workflow for performance"
   - Delegate to: LangGraph Engineer mode
   - Reason: Specialized knowledge and tool access

3. **Parallel independent tasks**
   - Example: "Create database migration AND write E2E tests"
   - Delegate to: Database Admin + QA Engineer (parallel)
   - Reason: Faster completion through parallelization

4. **Production operations** requiring approval gates
   - Example: "Deploy schema migration to production"
   - Delegate to: Database Admin mode
   - Reason: Approval gates ensure safety

---

### 2.2 Example Delegation Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Parallel Test Generation and Documentation
```
Primary Agent Instruction:
"I need to improve test coverage for the orchestration module 
while documenting the workflow patterns. Please delegate:

1. To OpenHands (QA Engineer mode):
   'Analyze src/agent_orchestration/ and create comprehensive 
   unit tests targeting 70% coverage. Use pytest-asyncio for 
   async tests. Report coverage metrics.'

2. To OpenHands (Architect mode):
   'Document the LangGraph workflow patterns in 
   src/agent_orchestration/ with examples and best practices.'

Reconvene when both tasks complete."
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Independent tasks run in parallel
- ✅ Each sub-agent has appropriate tool access
- ✅ Primary agent can continue other work
- ✅ Results merge without conflicts

---

#### Scenario 2: Production Database Migration
```
Primary Agent Instruction:
"We need to add a new column to the player_state table 
in production. Please delegate to OpenHands (Database Admin mode):

'Create a migration file for adding column 'therapeutic_score' 
to player_state table. Include:
1. Migration script with rollback
2. Backup verification steps
3. Performance impact analysis
4. Deployment checklist

Request approval before executing on production.'"
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Approval gates prevent accidental data loss
- ✅ Database Admin has specialized knowledge
- ✅ Backup verification ensures safety
- ✅ Deployment checklist ensures completeness

---

#### Scenario 3: Accessibility Audit and Fixes
```
Primary Agent Instruction:
"The player experience UI needs accessibility improvements. 
Please delegate to OpenHands (Frontend Developer mode):

'Audit src/player_experience/ components for WCAG 2.1 AA 
compliance. Create a report with:
1. Accessibility violations found
2. Recommended fixes with code examples
3. E2E tests for accessibility
4. Performance impact of fixes

Create a PR with all fixes implemented.'"
```

**Why This Works**:
- ✅ Frontend Developer has full UI access
- ✅ E2E testing with Playwright enabled
- ✅ Accessibility expertise in mode
- ✅ PR creation for review
