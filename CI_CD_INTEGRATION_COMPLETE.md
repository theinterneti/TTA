  - Overview of all generated test files
  - Test execution instructions
  - CI/CD integration details
  - Maintenance and extension guidelines
  
- **Test Generation Workflow:** `docs/testing/TEST_GENERATION_WORKFLOW.md`
  - Architecture overview
  - Step-by-step workflow guide
  - Configuration instructions
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Performance considerations

### 5. ✅ Verified CI/CD Integration
- GitHub Actions workflow YAML is valid
- pyproject.toml configuration is valid
- All test files are syntactically correct
- Coverage configuration is properly set up

## CI/CD Workflow Integration

### Automatic Test Execution

The generated tests now run automatically:

1. **On Push:** Every push to main, staging, or development branches
2. **On Pull Request:** Every PR to main or staging branches
3. **Coverage Reporting:** XML and HTML coverage reports generated
4. **Artifact Upload:** Test results and coverage reports uploaded

### Workflow Steps

```yaml
- name: Run generated tests
  run: |
    uv run pytest \
      tests/agent_orchestration/test_protocol_bridge.py \
      tests/agent_orchestration/test_capability_matcher.py \
      tests/agent_orchestration/test_circuit_breaker.py \
      -v --tb=short \
      --junitxml=test-results/generated-tests.xml \
      --cov=src/agent_orchestration \
      --cov-report=xml:coverage-generated.xml
  continue-on-error: true
```

## Running Tests Locally

### All Generated Tests

```bash
uv run pytest \
  tests/agent_orchestration/test_protocol_bridge.py \
  tests/agent_orchestration/test_capability_matcher.py \
  tests/agent_orchestration/test_circuit_breaker.py \
  -v
```

### With Coverage Report

```bash
uv run pytest \
  tests/agent_orchestration/test_protocol_bridge.py \
  tests/agent_orchestration/test_capability_matcher.py \
  tests/agent_orchestration/test_circuit_breaker.py \
  --cov=src/agent_orchestration \
  --cov-report=html
```

### Individual Test Files

```bash
# Protocol Bridge
uv run pytest tests/agent_orchestration/test_protocol_bridge.py -v

# Capability Matcher
uv run pytest tests/agent_orchestration/test_capability_matcher.py -v

# Circuit Breaker
uv run pytest tests/agent_orchestration/test_circuit_breaker.py -v
```
