gh issue create \
  --template packaging-fixes.md \
  --title "[PACKAGING] Fix workspace configuration and Python version" \
  --label "bug,packaging,critical" \
  --assignee @me
```

**3. Decide: Start Now or Later?**
- **Option A:** Start Phase 0 immediately (2-4 hours of work)
- **Option B:** Schedule Phase 0 for later this week
- **Option C:** Review and adjust plan first

---

## Phase 0: Quick Start Guide

**If you choose to start Phase 0 today:**

### Task 1: Fix Workspace Configuration (30 min)

```bash
# 1. Open pyproject.toml
vim pyproject.toml

# 2. Find [tool.uv.workspace] section (around line 303)

# 3. Add missing packages:
[tool.uv.workspace]
members = [
    "packages/tta-ai-framework",
    "packages/tta-narrative-engine",
    "packages/ai-dev-toolkit",           # ADD THIS
    "packages/universal-agent-context",  # ADD THIS
]

# 4. Save and validate
uv sync --all-extras

# 5. Commit
git add pyproject.toml
git commit -m "fix(packaging): Add missing packages to workspace configuration

- Add ai-dev-toolkit to workspace members
- Add universal-agent-context to workspace members
- Fixes workspace package discovery

Resolves: #[ISSUE_NUMBER]"
```

### Task 2: Standardize Python Version (30 min)

```bash
# 1. Update root pyproject.toml
vim pyproject.toml
# Change: requires-python = ">=3.10"
# To:     requires-python = ">=3.12"

# 2. Update all package pyproject.toml files
vim packages/tta-ai-framework/pyproject.toml
vim packages/tta-narrative-engine/pyproject.toml
vim packages/ai-dev-toolkit/pyproject.toml
vim packages/universal-agent-context/pyproject.toml
# Ensure all have: requires-python = ">=3.12"

# 3. Validate
grep -r "requires-python" pyproject.toml packages/*/pyproject.toml

# 4. Commit
git add pyproject.toml packages/*/pyproject.toml
git commit -m "fix(packaging): Standardize Python version to 3.12+

- Update root pyproject.toml to require Python 3.12+
- Update all package pyproject.toml files to match
- Ensures consistent Python version across project

Resolves: #[ISSUE_NUMBER]"
```

### Task 3: Add Version Constraints (30 min)

```bash
# 1. Open root pyproject.toml
vim pyproject.toml

# 2. Find [project] dependencies section

# 3. Pin workspace package versions:
[project]
dependencies = [
    "tta-ai-framework==0.1.0",
    "tta-narrative-engine==0.1.0",
    # ... other dependencies
]

# 4. Update lock file
rm uv.lock
uv sync --all-extras

# 5. Commit
git add pyproject.toml uv.lock
git commit -m "fix(packaging): Pin workspace package versions

- Pin tta-ai-framework to 0.1.0
- Pin tta-narrative-engine to 0.1.0
- Update lock file for reproducible builds

Resolves: #[ISSUE_NUMBER]"
```

### Task 4: Validate (30 min)

```bash
# 1. Clean environment
rm -rf .venv uv.lock

# 2. Fresh install
uv sync --all-extras

# 3. Run tests
uv run pytest -v

# 4. Run quality checks
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uvx pyright src/ packages/

# 5. If all pass, update GitHub issue
gh issue comment [NUMBER] --body "‚úÖ Phase 0 Complete

All packaging fixes implemented and validated:
- ‚úÖ Workspace configuration fixed (4 packages)
- ‚úÖ Python version standardized to 3.12+
- ‚úÖ Version constraints added
- ‚úÖ All tests passing
- ‚úÖ Quality checks passing

Ready to proceed with Phase 1."

# 6. Close issue
gh issue close [NUMBER]
```

**Total Time:** ~2-4 hours

## After Phase 0

### Option 1: Continue to Phase 1
- Start planning memory system extraction
- Create extraction specification
- Design tta-agent-coordination package

### Option 2: Take a Break
- Phase 0 is a good stopping point
- Commit and push changes
- Resume Phase 1 later

### Option 3: Adjust Plan
- Review what worked/didn't work in Phase 0
- Adjust roadmap if needed
- Update task list and GitHub issues

---

## Key Decisions Needed

### Decision 1: Timing
**When to start Phase 0?**
- [ ] Today (2-4 hours available)
- [ ] This week (schedule specific time)
- [ ] Next week (need more planning)

### Decision 2: Scope
**Should we adjust the scope?**
- [ ] Proceed as planned (all 5 phases)
- [ ] Focus on Phase 0 only for now
- [ ] Combine some phases

### Decision 3: Collaboration
**Will others be involved?**
- [ ] Solo work (you only)
- [ ] Team collaboration (need coordination)
- [ ] Review-only (others review your work)

‚úÖ You understand the hybrid tracking approach
‚úÖ You have 2-4 hours available for Phase 0
‚úÖ You're comfortable with the plan
‚úÖ You have access to both repositories

## Getting Help

### During Phase 0
```
Ask AI agent:
"I'm stuck on [TASK]. What should I do?"
"Show me the current task list"
"Mark task [NAME] as COMPLETE"
```

### For Planning Questions
```
Ask AI agent:
"Should I adjust the scope of Phase 1?"
"How do I create a GitHub issue from the template?"
"What's the best way to track progress?"
```

### For Technical Issues
```
Ask AI agent:
"I'm getting an error when running uv sync"
"How do I fix this dependency conflict?"
"What does this error message mean?"
```

## Recommended Next Step

**I recommend starting with Phase 0 today if you have 2-4 hours available.**

**Why?**
1. ‚úÖ Phase 0 is critical and blocks other work
2. ‚úÖ It's well-defined and low-risk
3. ‚úÖ You'll see immediate results
4. ‚úÖ It builds confidence for later phases
5. ‚úÖ It's a good test of the hybrid tracking approach

**If you agree:**
1. Create GitHub issue for Phase 0
2. Tell me: "Let's start Phase 0, Task 1"
3. I'll guide you through each step

**If you need more time:**
1. Review the documentation
2. Ask any questions
3. Schedule Phase 0 for later
4. We can adjust the plan as needed
