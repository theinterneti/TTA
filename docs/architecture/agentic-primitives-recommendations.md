# Agentic Primitives: Prioritized Recommendations for TTA

**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Audience:** Development Team, Product Owners
**Priority:** High

## Executive Summary

Based on analysis of the GitHub blog post on agentic primitives and context engineering, combined with a comprehensive review of TTA's current architecture, we recommend implementing **three foundational primitives** in the next sprint to significantly improve reliability, observability, and context management.

**TL;DR:**
- ‚úÖ TTA already has strong multi-agent coordination and state management
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical gaps in context window management, error recovery, and tool observability
- üéØ Recommended: Implement 3 foundational primitives in next 2 weeks
- üìà Expected impact: 95%+ reliability, zero token limit errors, complete tool visibility

---

## Top 3 Priorities (Next Sprint)

### ü•á Priority 1: Context Window Manager

**Why This Matters:**
- **Current Risk:** No explicit token limit management ‚Üí potential LLM API failures
- **Therapeutic Impact:** Context overflow could truncate critical therapeutic history
- **Performance Impact:** Inefficient context usage ‚Üí higher costs, slower responses

**What We'll Build:**
- Token counting and tracking
- Automatic context pruning (recency + relevance)
- Context summarization for older messages
- Multi-scale context management (immediate, session, historical)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Zero token limit errors
- 20-30% reduction in token usage
- Better context quality through intelligent pruning

**Effort:** 3-5 days
**Component Maturity:** Development ‚Üí Staging

**Code Location:** `src/agent_orchestration/context/window_manager.py`

**Integration Points:**
- `UnifiedAgentOrchestrator` - prompt building
- `LangGraphAgentOrchestrator` - workflow state
- `NarrativeGenerator` - narrative context

---

### ü•à Priority 2: Error Recovery Framework

**Why This Matters:**
- **Current Risk:** Inconsistent error handling ‚Üí poor user experience during failures
- **Therapeutic Impact:** Errors could break therapeutic alliance or cause user frustration
- **Reliability Impact:** No centralized recovery ‚Üí unpredictable failure modes

**What We'll Build:**
- Centralized error classification (LLM, validation, state, tool, timeout)
- Severity assessment (low, medium, high, critical)
- Recovery strategy registry with retry logic
- Fallback mechanisms for graceful degradation

**Expected Outcomes:**
- 95%+ error recovery success rate
- Consistent error handling across all agents
- Better user experience during failures

**Effort:** 4-6 days
**Component Maturity:** Development ‚Üí Staging

**Code Location:** `src/agent_orchestration/recovery/error_handler.py`

**Integration Points:**
- All agent adapters (IPA, WBA, NGA)
- `WorkflowManager` - workflow-level recovery
- `CircuitBreaker` - enhanced resilience

---

### ü•â Priority 3: Tool Execution Observability

**Why This Matters:**
- **Current Risk:** Limited visibility into tool execution ‚Üí difficult debugging
- **Development Impact:** Hard to diagnose tool-related issues
- **Performance Impact:** No tool performance insights ‚Üí missed optimization opportunities

**What We'll Build:**
- Structured tool execution logging
- Tool performance metrics (duration, success rate, error rate)
- Tool result validation framework
- Execution trace visualization

**Expected Outcomes:**
- 100% tool execution visibility
- Tool performance dashboards
- Faster debugging and optimization

**Effort:** 3-4 days
**Component Maturity:** Development ‚Üí Staging

**Code Location:** Extend `src/agent_orchestration/tools/metrics.py`

**Integration Points:**
- `ToolInvocationService` - execution tracking
- `ToolRegistry` - metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards - visualization

**Why:** Enables more sophisticated therapeutic scenarios with coherent multi-turn interactions

**Effort:** 5-7 days
**Component Maturity:** Development

### 5. Dynamic Prompt Assembly

**What:** Dynamic prompt builder, few-shot example selector, prompt optimization

**Why:** Improves prompt quality and agent performance through adaptive prompting

**Effort:** 4-6 days
**Component Maturity:** Development

**Code Location:** Extend `src/ai_components/prompts.py`

---

### 6. Distributed Tracing

**What:** End-to-end tracing across agent workflows, span creation, trace visualization

**Why:** Essential for performance optimization and debugging complex workflows

**Effort:** 6-8 days
**Component Maturity:** Staging

**Code Location:** `src/agent_orchestration/tracing/`
