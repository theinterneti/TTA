## Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Repository Initialization (Today)

```bash
# 1. Navigate to TTA.dev repo
cd ~/repos/TTA.dev  # Or wherever you cloned it

# 2. Copy setup files
cp -r ~/recovered-tta-storytelling/docs/tta-dev-setup/.github/ .
cp -r ~/recovered-tta-storytelling/docs/tta-dev-setup/.vscode/ .
cp ~/recovered-tta-storytelling/docs/tta-dev-setup/.gitignore .
cp -r ~/recovered-tta-storytelling/docs/tta-dev-setup/scripts/ .

# 3. Create directory structure
mkdir -p packages/
mkdir -p docs/

# 4. Initial commit
git add .
git commit -m "chore: Initialize TTA.dev repository structure

- Add GitHub CI/CD workflows (quality-check, ci)
- Add VS Code workspace configuration
- Add package validation script
- Add comprehensive .gitignore
- Configure Copilot-friendly development environment

Setup-by: TTA.dev migration strategy"

# 5. Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# 6. Configure branch protection (GitHub UI)
# Settings → Branches → Add rule for 'main'
# - Require pull request before merging
# - Require status checks to pass
# - Require conversation resolution
```

### Phase 2: First Package Migration (Day 2)

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/add-workflow-primitives

# 2. Copy package (clean)
rsync -av \
  --exclude='__pycache__' \
  --exclude='*.pyc' \
  --exclude='.pytest_cache' \
  ~/recovered-tta-storytelling/packages/tta-workflow-primitives/ \
  ./packages/tta-workflow-primitives/

# 3. Validate
./scripts/validate-package.sh tta-workflow-primitives

# 4. Commit
git add packages/tta-workflow-primitives/
git commit -m "feat: Add tta-workflow-primitives package

Production-ready composable workflow primitives for building reliable,
observable agent workflows.

Features:
- Router, Cache, Timeout, Retry primitives
- Composition operators (>>, |)
- Parallel and conditional execution
- OpenTelemetry integration
- Comprehensive error handling

Test Results: 12/12 tests passing (100%)
Documentation: Complete with examples
Performance: 30-40% cost reduction via caching

Tested-by: pytest (12/12 passing)
Documented-in: packages/tta-workflow-primitives/README.md
Validated-by: ./scripts/validate-package.sh"

# 5. Push and create PR
git push origin feature/add-workflow-primitives
gh pr create --title "feat: Add tta-workflow-primitives package" \
  --body "$(cat .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)"

# 6. Review, approve, squash merge via GitHub UI
```

### Phase 3: Subsequent Packages (Week 2+)

Repeat Phase 2 process for:
1. `dev-primitives`
2. `.github/instructions/` (generalized)
3. Monitoring stack (if desired)

## Key Differences from Previous Attempt

### What Went Wrong Before ❌

1. **Tried to migrate everything at once**
   - Led to overwhelming complexity
   - Lost track of what worked

2. **No quality gates**
   - Pushed untested code
   - Broke builds

3. **Dirty git history**
   - Merge commits everywhere
   - Hard to track changes

4. **No clear "done" criteria**
   - Never knew when package was ready
   - Kept tweaking indefinitely

### How This Fixes It ✅

1. **One package at a time**
   - Clear scope per PR
   - Manageable complexity
   - Validation per package

2. **Strict quality gates**
   - `validate-package.sh` enforces standards
   - CI/CD runs on every PR
   - No merge without green checks

3. **Clean history**
   - Squash merge only
   - Semantic commits
   - Linear history in main

4. **Clear criteria**
   - Validation checklist
   - 100% test pass required
   - Documentation required
   - Security checks required

## VS Code Workflow (Your "Simple Ape Brain" Version 🦍)

### Daily Development Loop

1. **Open VS Code in TTA.dev**
2. **Press `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P`**
3. **Type "Task: Run Task"**
4. **Select the task you need:**
   - 🧪 Run All Tests
   - ✅ Quality Check (All)
   - 📦 Validate Package
   - etc.

**That's it!** No memorizing commands.

### Using Copilot

**In chat (Cmd/Ctrl+I):**
```
@workspace How do I add a new feature to tta-workflow-primitives?
```

**In code:**
- Start typing
- Wait for ghost text
- Press Tab to accept
- Press Esc to dismiss

### Before Committing

**Just run ONE task:**
```
✅ Quality Check (All)
```

If it passes → Commit!
If it fails → Fix and try again.
