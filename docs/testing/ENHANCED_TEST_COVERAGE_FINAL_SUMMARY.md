## Key Discoveries and Edge Cases

### Edge Cases Found Through Property-Based Testing

1. **Duplicate Model IDs** (Phase 1)
   - Models can have duplicate IDs with different properties
   - Solution: Deduplication logic in tests

2. **Free Models with Non-Zero Costs** (Phase 1)
   - Free models can have cost_per_token > 0
   - Solution: Explicit filtering logic

3. **None Values in Model Properties** (Phase 2)
   - Models with None for context_length bypass compatibility filters
   - Solution: Explicit value checks before comparison

4. **Hypothesis Fixture Incompatibility** (Phase 2)
   - `@given` decorator doesn't work with pytest fixtures
   - Solution: Helper functions instead of fixtures

5. **Therapeutic Safety Requirement Default** (Phase 3)
   - ModelRequirements defaults therapeutic_safety_required=True
   - Solution: Explicit False setting in non-therapeutic tests

   - Historical performance data influences selection
   - High-performance models preferred

3. **Fallback with Performance Tracking** ✅
   - Fallback operations tracked
   - Metadata correctly recorded

4. **End-to-End Workflow** ✅

---

## Contract Testing Results

### IModelProvider Interface Compliance

**OpenRouterProvider:** ✅ COMPLIANT

**Required Methods Verified:**
- ✅ `provider_type` property
- ✅ `initialize(config)` - async, returns bool
- ✅ `get_available_models(filters)` - async, returns list[ModelInfo]
- ✅ `load_model(model_id, config)` - async, returns IModelInstance
- ✅ `unload_model(model_id)` - async, returns bool
- ✅ `cleanup()` - async cleanup method

**Method Signatures:** ✅ Consistent across providers
**Return Types:** ✅ Correct and validated
**Async Patterns:** ✅ Properly implemented

---

## Mutation Testing Status

### Manual Mutation Testing Completed

**Status:** ✅ Complete (manual approach used)
**Execution:** ✅ Performed on ModelSelector
**Execution Time:** 5 minutes

**Why Manual Testing:**
Mutmut has fundamental incompatibility with the project's complex package structure (doesn't copy parent `__init__.py` files, causing import errors). Manual mutation testing was performed as an effective alternative.

**Results:**
- **Mutations Tested:** 5 (3 applied successfully, 2 failed due to line mismatches)
- **Mutations Killed:** 0
- **Mutations Survived:** 3
- **Mutation Score:** 0% (0/3 killed)

**Critical Findings:**
1. ⚠️ **Therapeutic safety scoring** can be zeroed out without test failure
2. ⚠️ **Performance scoring** can be removed without test failure
3. ⚠️ **Default score values** can be changed without test failure

**Root Cause:**
Property-based tests validate structural properties (e.g., "list is sorted") but do NOT validate correctness of the scoring algorithm. Tests recalculate scores using the same (potentially mutated) logic, so mutations survive.

**Recommended Improvements:**
- Add concrete ranking tests with specific model configurations
- Add score calculation tests with known expected values
- Add default value validation tests
- **Projected Score After Improvements:** ~80% (target achievable)

**Future Automation:**
Cosmic Ray recommended for automated mutation testing (better package structure handling than mutmut).
