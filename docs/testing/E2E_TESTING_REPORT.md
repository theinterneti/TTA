**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Session is created with character + world
- ✅ Session ID is generated and included in URL
- ✅ Session data persists to Redis
- ✅ Session survives page refresh

   - Progress markers

3. **Session State**
   - Session ID in Redis
   - Character-world association
   - Session status (ACTIVE, PAUSED, COMPLETED)

   - Messages in Redis (30-day TTL)
   - AI responses
   - Therapeutic progress analysis

5. **Progress Data**
   - Milestones in database
   - Skill acquisition markers
   - Therapeutic metrics

### Persistence Validation Checklist

- [ ] JWT token survives page refresh
- [ ] Character data survives browser restart
- [ ] Session state survives page refresh

## Test Execution Results

**Status**: Tests created and ready for execution

**Next Steps**:
1. Execute test suite with Playwright
2. Document test results
3. Fix any failing tests
4. Generate HTML test report
5. Update this document with actual results

---

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Frontend TypeScript Warnings**
   - Multiple unused variable warnings
   - Type mismatches in Redux slices
   - These are development warnings and don't affect functionality

2. **Test Data Cleanup**
   - Tests create new users/characters/sessions
   - Need cleanup script to remove test data
   - Consider using test database for E2E tests

3. **AI Response Timing**
   - AI responses may take 10-30 seconds
   - Tests must account for variable response times
   - Consider using mock AI for faster tests

### Recommendations

1. **Implement Test Data Cleanup**
   ```bash
   # Create cleanup script
   scripts/cleanup-test-data.sh
   ```

2. **Add Test Database Configuration**
   - Use separate Neo4j database for tests
   - Use separate Redis database for tests
   - Prevent test data pollution

3. **Improve Test Reliability**
   - Add retry logic for flaky tests
   - Increase timeouts for AI responses
   - Add better error messages
