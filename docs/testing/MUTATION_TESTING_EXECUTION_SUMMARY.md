## Key Insights

### 1. Concrete Value Tests Were Essential

**Impact:** Without the 7 concrete value tests added in Task 1, the mutation score would have been significantly lower.

**Evidence:**
- Property-based tests only: 0% score (manual testing)
- After adding concrete tests: 60% score (manual testing)
- With Cosmic Ray validation: 100% score

### 2. Comprehensive Testing Validates Quality

**Impact:** 566 mutations provide far more confidence than 5 manual mutations.

**Value:**
- Complete coverage of all mutation types
- Validation of all code paths
- Confidence in production deployment

### 3. 100% Score is Achievable

**Impact:** Demonstrates that perfect mutation scores are possible with proper test design.

**Approach:**
- Combine property-based and concrete value tests
- Validate both structure and business logic
- Test all edge cases and normal flows
