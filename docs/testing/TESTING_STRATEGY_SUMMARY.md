## Current State

### Test Infrastructure Maturity: **HIGH** ✅

- **971 Python test functions** across 123 test files
- **20 TypeScript E2E test specs** with Playwright
- **7 GitHub Actions workflows** for CI/CD
- **Comprehensive test battery** with mock fallback support

- **Performance and load testing** infrastructure (Locust)
- **Accessibility and responsive design** testing

### Overall Test Coverage: **~68%**

| Component | Coverage | Target | Gap |
|-----------|----------|--------|-----|
| Authentication | 75% | 95% | -20% |
| Story Generation | 70% | 85% | -15% |
| Database Layer | 75% | 90% | -15% |
| API Endpoints | 65% | 85% | -20% |
| Frontend Components | 60% | 75% | -15% |
| Gameplay Mechanics | 70% | 85% | -15% |

## Key Gaps Identified

### Critical Gaps (Must Address)

1. **End-to-End User Journeys** - Limited tests for complete user flows with real database persistence
2. **Multi-Session Continuity** - Insufficient testing of save/load/resume functionality
3. **API Integration** - Incomplete coverage of all API endpoints and error scenarios
4. **Database Failure Scenarios** - Minimal testing of database unavailability and recovery

### High Priority Gaps

1. **Frontend Component Tests** - React components lack comprehensive unit tests
2. **Narrative Quality Validation** - Limited automated testing of narrative coherence and consistency
3. **WebSocket Lifecycle** - Incomplete testing of connection/disconnection/reconnection flows
4. **Performance Benchmarks** - No established baseline for performance metrics
