**Error Details**:
```
HTTP 422 Unprocessable Entity
URL: http://localhost:8081/api/v1/characters/
Error: Validation Error
Message: Invalid request data
Details: Array(1)
```

**Note**: The API endpoint shows port 8081 instead of 8080, which might indicate a configuration mismatch.

**Screenshots**:
- `e2e-test-03-characters-empty.png` - Empty characters list
- `e2e-test-04-character-form-basic.png` - Basic info step
- `e2e-test-05-character-form-therapeutic.png` - Therapeutic profile step

**Console Errors**:
- üî¥ "Failed to create character: {}"
- üî¥ "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 422"

---

### 3. Session Persistence ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL FAILURE

**Test Steps**:
1. Login successfully
2. Navigate to /characters
3. Attempt to navigate to /worlds
4. Observe session state

**Results**:
- ‚ùå Session lost when navigating to /worlds
- ‚ùå Redirected back to /login
- ‚ùå JWT token not persisting in localStorage
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Session restoration shows: `{success: false, restored: {auth: false, session: false, conversation: false}}`

**Expected Behavior**:
- JWT token should be stored in `localStorage.tta_access_token`
- Token should persist across page navigation
- User should remain authenticated

**Actual Behavior**:
- Token appears to be lost on navigation
- User is logged out unexpectedly
- Session restoration fails

---

### 4. Recurring Console Errors

**Critical Error** (appears repeatedly):
```
Failed to retrieve session data: RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded
```

**Frequency**: Appears on almost every page interaction

**Impact**:
- May be causing session persistence issues
- Indicates infinite recursion in session retrieval code
- Could be related to the session restoration logic

**Recommendation**: Investigate `sessionRestoration.ts` for circular dependencies or infinite loops

---

## Data Persistence Validation

### Character Data (Neo4j)
- ‚ùå **NOT TESTED** - Character creation failed before persistence could be validated
- Expected: Character should be stored in Neo4j with all therapeutic goals
- Actual: Unable to create character due to validation error

### Session State (Redis)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY VALIDATED**
- Existing data: 1 session key, 1 conversation key found
- New session: Not created due to character creation failure
- Token persistence: Failed - token not surviving navigation

### Conversation History (Redis)
- ‚ùå **NOT TESTED** - Could not reach chat interface due to character creation failure
- Expected: Messages stored with 30-day TTL
- Actual: Unable to test

---

## OpenRouter AI Integration

### Configuration
- ‚úÖ API key configured in .env
- ‚úÖ Key format: `sk-or-v1-...` (valid OpenRouter format)

### Testing
- ‚ùå **NOT TESTED** - Could not reach chat interface
- Unable to verify:
  - AI response time
  - Therapeutic context usage
  - Conversation flow

---

## Critical Issues Discovered

### 1. Character Creation Validation Error (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Issue**: Character creation fails with 422 Unprocessable Entity

**Possible Causes**:
- API endpoint mismatch (port 8081 vs 8080)
- Missing required fields in request payload
- Field format mismatch (e.g., therapeutic_goals structure)
- Backend validation rules not matching frontend form

**Impact**: Blocks entire user journey - cannot proceed without a character

**Recommendation**:
1. Check API endpoint configuration in frontend
2. Compare frontend payload with backend expected schema
3. Review character creation validation rules
4. Add better error messages to show which fields are invalid

### 2. Session Persistence Failure (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Issue**: JWT token not persisting across page navigation

**Possible Causes**:
- Token not being saved to localStorage
- Token being cleared on navigation
- Session restoration logic failing
- Infinite recursion in session retrieval

**Impact**: User logged out unexpectedly, poor user experience

**Recommendation**:
1. Fix "Maximum call stack size exceeded" error
2. Verify token storage in localStorage
3. Add token expiration handling
4. Improve session restoration logic

### 3. Infinite Recursion in Session Retrieval (CRITICAL)

**Issue**: "Maximum call stack size exceeded" error on every interaction

**Possible Causes**:
- Circular dependency in session restoration code
- Infinite loop in session state management
- React component re-rendering loop

**Impact**: Performance degradation, potential session issues

**Recommendation**:
1. Review `sessionRestoration.ts` for circular calls
2. Check React component dependencies
3. Add recursion guards
4. Refactor session state management

   # Test character creation directly
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/characters \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d @test-character.json
   ```

2. **Fix Session Persistence**
   - Review `src/player_experience/frontend/src/utils/sessionRestoration.ts`
   - Check localStorage implementation
   - Test token storage manually in browser console

3. **Re-run E2E Tests**
   - Execute Playwright test suite after fixes
   - Validate complete user journey
   - Document results

---

## Conclusion

The TTA MVP platform has a solid foundation with working authentication and well-designed UI components. However, critical issues in character creation validation and session persistence prevent the complete user journey from functioning. These issues must be resolved before the platform can be considered production-ready.

**Priority**: Fix character creation validation and session persistence before proceeding with further testing.

**Estimated Time to Fix**: 2-4 hours for character creation, 1-2 hours for session persistence

**Next Test**: Re-run complete E2E test suite after fixes are implemented
