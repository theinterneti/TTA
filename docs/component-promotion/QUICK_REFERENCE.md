## 📞 Quick Help

### Common Issues

**Q: Linting auto-fix doesn't resolve all issues?**
A: Some issues require manual fixes. Review remaining issues and fix manually.

**Q: Type checking errors persist after fixes?**
A: Ensure all null checks are in place. Pattern: `if metadata and 'key' in metadata:`

**Q: README template doesn't fit component?**
A: Customize sections as needed. Focus on: Overview, Features, Usage, API, Testing.

**Q: Deployment fails?**
A: Check Docker logs, verify environment variables, ensure dependencies are available.
