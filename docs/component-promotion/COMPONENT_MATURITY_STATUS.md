## Correction Notice

**IMPORTANT**: Previous versions of this document incorrectly stated that Narrative Arc Orchestrator had 70.3% test coverage. This figure was based on outdated/unverified data from 2025-10-09.

**Verified Current Coverage** (per GitHub Issue #42, 2025-10-13 21:15 UTC): **42.9%**

The component requires an additional **27.1% coverage** to meet the 70% staging promotion threshold. This correction has been applied throughout this document and related planning materials.

**Source of Truth**: GitHub Issue #42 (automated daily updates) and component-maturity-analysis.json
