# Top 3 Priority Components for Staging Promotion

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-13 (CORRECTED)
**Planning Horizon**: Next 2 weeks (2025-10-14 to 2025-10-27)

---

## ⚠️ CORRECTION NOTICE

**Previous Version Error**: This document previously stated Narrative Arc Orchestrator had 70.3% coverage. This was **INCORRECT** based on unverified/outdated data.

**Verified Current Coverage** (per GitHub Issue #42): **42.9%**

The priorities have been **reordered** to reflect accurate data and component readiness.

---

## Executive Summary

Based on the comprehensive component maturity assessment with **CORRECTED** coverage data, the following 3 components are prioritized for staging promotion over the next 2 weeks:

| Priority | Component | Coverage | Effort | Target Date | Status |
|----------|-----------|----------|--------|-------------|--------|
| **P0** | **Carbon** | **70.6% ✅** | **Immediate** | **2025-10-14** | **🟢 READY NOW** |
| **P1** | Model Management | 100% ✅ | 2-3 days | 2025-10-17 | 🔴 Code quality issues |
| **P1** | Gameplay Loop | 100% ✅ | 2-3 days | 2025-10-17 | 🔴 Code quality issues |

**Total Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days (Carbon ready immediately)
**Expected Outcome**: 3 additional components in staging by 2025-10-17

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Linting Fixes Take Longer Than Expected
**Mitigation**: Use auto-fix for 80% of issues, focus manual effort on critical issues only

### Risk 2: Type Checking Reveals Architectural Issues
**Mitigation**: Document issues, create follow-up tasks, don't block promotion for non-critical issues

### Risk 3: Security Issue (B615) Requires Significant Refactoring
**Mitigation**: Implement safe download wrapper, defer full refactoring to post-staging

### Risk 4: Staging Deployment Failures
**Mitigation**: Test deployment in dev environment first, have rollback plan ready
