## Monitoring & Validation

### Daily Checks (During Observation Period)

**Logs**:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml logs --tail=100 carbon
```

**Integration Tests**:
```bash
uv run pytest tests/integration/ -k carbon -v
```

**Metrics**:
- Grafana Dashboard: http://staging.tta.local/grafana
- Prometheus Metrics: http://staging.tta.local/prometheus
- Check: CPU usage, memory usage, energy tracking accuracy

**Error Monitoring**:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml logs carbon | grep -i error
```

---

## Rollback Plan

**If critical issues are discovered:**

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml stop carbon
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml rm -f carbon
   ```

2. **Documentation**:
   - Document root cause in this issue
   - Update component status to "Development"
   - Create fix plan

3. **Re-Promotion**:
   - Fix issues in development
   - Re-verify all criteria
   - Create new promotion issue

```

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Deploy to staging
./scripts/deploy-staging.sh --component carbon

# Check deployment status
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml ps carbon

# View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.staging.yml logs -f carbon

# Health check

## Notes

- This is the **first component** to be promoted to staging using the corrected priority order
- Carbon was previously deprioritized in favor of Narrative Arc Orchestrator (which had incorrect 70.3% coverage data)
- With accurate data, Carbon is the clear P0 choice with zero blockers
- Successful promotion will validate the component maturity workflow
