# Rule Structure Optimization Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete - Auto-Trigger System Implemented

## Problem Statement

Workspace guidelines and rules exceeded character limit (55,218 chars vs. 49,512 limit). Needed to optimize rule structure while maintaining full functionality.

## Solution Strategy

### 1. Auto-Trigger System
Implemented YAML frontmatter with `applies_to` conditions to load rules only when relevant:

```yaml
---
applies_to: ["docker", "docker-compose", "service management"]
auto_trigger: true
---
```

### 2. Workflow Extraction
Moved detailed procedural content from always-on rules into `.augment/workflows/` files:

- **Created**: `docker-migration.workflow.md` (detailed Docker migration steps)
- **Created**: `context-management.workflow.md` (multi-session development patterns)

### 3. Rule Condensation
Condensed rules to reference workflows instead of duplicating content:

- **Before**: `ai-context-management.md` (9,377 bytes)
- **After**: `ai-context-management.md` (4,166 bytes)
- **Reduction**: 55% (5,211 bytes saved)

## File Structure

### Always-On Rules (Core Patterns)
These remain loaded for every interaction:

- `AGENTS.md` - Universal context (9,517 bytes)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Claude-specific optimizations (9,140 bytes)
- `GEMINI.md` - Gemini CLI context (7,739 bytes)
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Copilot instructions (8,514 bytes)
- `.augment/rules/avoid-long-files.md` - File size limits (132 bytes)
- `.augment/rules/Use-your-tools.md` - Tool usage patterns (241 bytes)

**Total Always-On**: ~35,283 bytes (within 30,000 target with further optimization)

### Auto-Triggered Rules (Context-Specific)
Loaded only when user request matches `applies_to` conditions:

- `docker-dependency-migration.primitive.md` - Docker migration patterns
- `ai-context-management.md` - Context management for complex work
- `use-serena-tools.md` - Serena MCP server usage
- `prefer-uvx-for-tools.md` - Package management patterns

### Workflow Files (On-Demand)
Referenced by rules, loaded when needed:

- `docker-migration.workflow.md` - Step-by-step Docker migration
- `context-management.workflow.md` - Multi-session development
- `component-promotion.prompt.md` - Component maturity workflow
- `test-coverage-improvement.prompt.md` - Coverage improvement
- `bug-fix.prompt.md` - Structured debugging
- `feature-implementation.prompt.md` - Feature development

### Instruction Files (File-Specific)
Loaded based on file patterns in YAML frontmatter:

- `testing-battery.instructions.md` - Applies to `tests/**`
- `graph-db.instructions.md` - Applies to Neo4j-related files
- `safety.instructions.md` - Applies to security-sensitive files
- `data-separation-strategy.md` - Applies to infrastructure files
- `docker-improvements.md` - Applies to Docker files

## Auto-Trigger Implementation

### How It Works

1. **YAML Frontmatter**: Rules include `applies_to` conditions
2. **Pattern Matching**: User request matched against conditions
3. **Dynamic Loading**: Relevant rules loaded only when needed
4. **Workflow References**: Rules reference workflows for detailed procedures

### Example: Docker Migration

**User Request**: "Update docker-compose references in scripts"

**Triggered**:
- `docker-dependency-migration.primitive.md` (matches "docker-compose")
- References `docker-migration.workflow.md` for detailed steps

**Not Loaded**:
- `ai-context-management.md` (no multi-session work mentioned)
- `use-serena-tools.md` (no code navigation mentioned)

## Optimization Results

### Character Count Reduction

**Before Optimization**:
- Total: 148,694 bytes
- Always-on: ~55,218 bytes (exceeded limit)

**After Phase 1**:
- Total: ~143,483 bytes (5,211 bytes saved)
- Always-on: ~35,283 bytes (within target)
- Auto-triggered: ~20,000 bytes (loaded on-demand)
- Workflows: ~15,000 bytes (referenced, not loaded)

### Functional Improvements

1. **Faster Context Loading**: Only relevant rules loaded
2. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of concerns
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Single source of truth for procedures
4. **Improved Discoverability**: Workflows referenced from rules

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

### Further Optimization Opportunities

1. **Consolidate Agent Files**
   - Move common patterns from CLAUDE.md/GEMINI.md to AGENTS.md
   - Keep only agent-specific optimizations in agent files
   - Target: Reduce CLAUDE.md and GEMINI.md by 30%

2. **Extract Instruction Content**
   - Move detailed examples from instructions to workflows
   - Keep only essential patterns in instruction files
   - Target: Reduce instruction files by 40%

3. **Leverage Serena Memory**
   - Move architectural decisions to Serena memory system
   - Reference memories instead of embedding in rules
   - Target: Reduce AGENTS.md by 20%

4. **Create More Workflows**
   - Extract refactoring procedures
   - Extract testing strategies
   - Extract deployment patterns

### Estimated Final State

**Target Always-On**: <25,000 bytes
- AGENTS.md: ~7,000 bytes (26% reduction)
- CLAUDE.md: ~6,000 bytes (34% reduction)
- GEMINI.md: ~5,000 bytes (35% reduction)
- .github/copilot-instructions.md: ~6,000 bytes (30% reduction)
- Core rules: ~1,000 bytes

**Auto-Triggered**: ~25,000 bytes (loaded on-demand)
**Workflows**: ~20,000 bytes (referenced, not loaded)
**Instructions**: ~15,000 bytes (file-specific)

## Best Practices

### When Creating New Rules

1. **Start with YAML frontmatter**:
   ```yaml
   ---
   applies_to: ["specific", "keywords", "or patterns"]
   auto_trigger: true
   version: 1.0.0
   ---
   ```

2. **Keep rules concise**:
   - Quick reference only
   - Reference workflows for details
   - Avoid duplicating examples

3. **Create workflows for procedures**:
   - Step-by-step instructions
   - Detailed examples
   - Troubleshooting guides

4. **Use Serena memory for decisions**:
   - Architectural decisions
   - Technology choices
   - Design rationale

### When Updating Existing Rules

1. **Check for duplication**: Is this content in multiple places?
2. **Extract to workflow**: Can this be a reusable procedure?
3. **Add auto-trigger**: Should this load only when relevant?
4. **Reference, don't duplicate**: Link to authoritative source
