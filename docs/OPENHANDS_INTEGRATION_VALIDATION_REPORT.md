- **Model Preset:** gemini-flash (1M context window)
- **Workspace:** openhands_workspace
- **API Key:** Successfully loaded from environment

### ✅ Test 3: Docker Client Initialization
- **Status:** PASS
- **OpenHands Image:** docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/openhands:0.59
- **Runtime Image:** docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.59-nikolaik
- **Docker Configuration:** Verified with DNS, TTY, and permission fixes

### ✅ Test 4: Real Task Execution
- **Status:** PASS
- **Task:** Create a file named 'openhands_test.txt' with content 'Hello from OpenHands'
- **Execution Time:** 53.98 seconds
- **File Created:** ✅ openhands_workspace/openhands_test.txt
- **File Content:** ✅ "Hello from OpenHands"
- **Exit Code:** 0 (success)

## Issues Resolved

| # | Issue | Root Cause | Solution | Status |
|---|-------|-----------|----------|--------|
| 1 | TTY Device Not Available | Unconditional `-i`/`-t` flags | Detect TTY availability | ✅ |
| 2 | Permission Denied | Root-owned `.openhands` directory | Create dir in container | ✅ |
| 3 | Infinite Loop | History truncation + small context | Switch to gemini-flash | ✅ |
| 4 | Context Window Exceeded | deepseek-v3 (64K) insufficient | Use gemini-flash (1M) | ✅ |
| 5 | DNS Resolution Failed | No DNS in container | Add `--dns 8.8.8.8` | ✅ |

---

## Configuration Changes

### 1. Environment Variables (.env)
```bash
# Changed from deepseek-v3 to gemini-flash
OPENHANDS_MODEL=gemini-flash
# Commented out custom model ID to use preset
# OPENHANDS_CUSTOM_MODEL_ID=openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3.1:free
```

### 2. Docker Command Enhancements
**File:** `src/agent_orchestration/openhands_integration/docker_client.py`

**Added:**
- TTY detection logic
- DNS configuration (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4)
- Environment variables:
  - `MAX_ITERATIONS=100` (prevent infinite loops)
  - `AGENT_ENABLE_HISTORY_TRUNCATION=false` (prevent condensation loop)
  - `FILE_STORE=memory` (avoid permission issues)
  - `FILE_STORE_PATH=/tmp/openhands_store`
- Directory creation in container: `mkdir -p /.openhands`

### 3. Test Suite
**File:** `scripts/test_openhands_integration.py`

Comprehensive test suite with 4 tests:
1. Environment file verification
2. Configuration loading
3. Docker client initialization
4. Real task execution with OpenRouter API

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Config Loading | < 1s | Fast environment variable parsing |
| Docker Client Init | < 2s | Quick client setup |
| Task Execution | 50-75s | Includes Docker startup + inference |
| Total Test Suite | ~2 min | All 4 tests complete |
| API Response Time | ~30-40s | OpenRouter API latency |

---

## Model Selection

**Selected Model:** Google Gemini 2.0 Flash (gemini-flash)

**Rationale:**
- **Context Window:** 1,000,000 tokens (vs 64K for deepseek-v3)
- **Free Tier:** ✅ Available on OpenRouter
- **Stability:** ✅ No infinite loops or context window errors
- **Performance:** ✅ Fast inference (~30-40s for simple tasks)
- **Compatibility:** ✅ Full OpenHands support

**Alternative Models:**
- deepseek-v3: 64K context (limited for long conversations)
- mistral-small: 32K context (too small)
- llama-scout: 190M context (experimental, untested)
