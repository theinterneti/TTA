- No issues encountered during deployment
- All security fixes confirmed working
- No performance impact
- No runtime errors

**Next Steps:**
1. Schedule production deployment window
2. Update production container images with Phase 2 dependencies
3. Deploy to production using same hot-deployment method
4. Monitor production logs for 24 hours
5. Verify Dependabot rescan shows 0 alerts

### 2. Container Image Rebuild 📋 REQUIRED

**Current State:** Dependencies updated via hot deployment (temporary)

**Action Required:** Rebuild container images with updated requirements files

**Priority:** Medium (before next container restart)

**Steps:**
```bash
# Rebuild Player API image
cd src/player_experience/franchise_worlds/deployment
docker-compose build --no-cache

# Rebuild Health Check image
cd monitoring/health-check-service
docker build -t tta-health-check:latest .
```

### 3. Monitor Dependabot Rescan 📊 IN PROGRESS

**Expected Timeline:** 1-4 hours after Phase 2 merge

**Action:** Verify all 46 Dependabot alerts are closed
