# OpenHands Access Methods: Detailed Comparison

**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Analysis:** Comprehensive comparison of all three access methods

---

## Method 1: Direct API Calls

### Overview
Direct HTTP requests to OpenRouter API, bypassing OpenHands entirely.

### Architecture
```
Your Code → HTTP Request → OpenRouter API → LLM → Response
```

### Capabilities
✅ **Supported:**
- Code generation
- Code analysis
- Documentation writing
- Problem solving
- Planning and design

❌ **Not Supported:**
- File creation
- Bash execution
- Jupyter notebooks
- Web automation
- Tool execution

### Implementation
```python
import httpx

async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
    response = await client.post(
        "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"},
        json={
            "model": "deepseek/deepseek-chat",
            "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": task}],
        }
    )
    result = response.json()
```

### Performance
- **Latency:** 1-30 seconds (depends on task complexity)
- **Token Usage:** 100-4000 tokens (depends on task)
- **Cost:** $0.001-$0.01 per task (very low)

### Test Results
| Task | Status | Time | Tokens |
|------|--------|------|--------|
| Simple (hello world) | ✅ PASS | 1.8s | ~200 |
| Moderate (function) | ✅ PASS | 6.7s | ~800 |
| Complex (tests) | ✅ PASS | 31.2s | ~3000 |

### Pros
- ✅ Simple to implement
- ✅ Fast execution
- ✅ Low cost
- ✅ No dependencies
- ✅ Reliable

### Cons
- ❌ No file creation
- ❌ No bash execution
- ❌ No tool access
- ❌ Limited to LLM tasks

### Best For
- Code generation
- Code analysis
- Documentation
- Planning
- Quick prototyping

### Not Suitable For
- File creation
- Test generation (that needs to be saved)
- Build automation
- DevOps tasks
- Full development workflows

## Method 2: OpenHands SDK

### Overview
Python SDK wrapper around OpenHands agent.

### Architecture
```
Your Code → OpenHands SDK → Agent (limited tools) → LLM → Response
```

### Capabilities
✅ **Supported:**
- Internal reasoning (`think` tool)
- Task completion (`finish` tool)
- LLM interaction

❌ **Not Supported:**
- File creation
- Bash execution
- Jupyter notebooks
- Web automation
- Any tool execution

### Implementation
```python
from openhands.sdk import Agent, LLM

llm = LLM(model="openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-chat", api_key=key)
agent = Agent(llm=llm)
conversation = agent.create_conversation(workspace="/path")
conversation.send_message(task)
conversation.run()
```

### Performance
- **Latency:** 2-40 seconds
- **Token Usage:** 100-4000 tokens
- **Cost:** $0.001-$0.01 per task

### Limitations
- Only 2 tools available: `think`, `finish`
- No file operations
- No bash execution
- No tool registration
- Agent can only propose code, not create it

### Pros
- ✅ Simple Python API
- ✅ Integrated with OpenHands
- ✅ Good for learning

### Cons
- ❌ Very limited capabilities
- ❌ No file creation
- ❌ No bash execution
- ❌ Not suitable for production
- ❌ Misleading (looks like full agent but isn't)

### Best For
- Learning OpenHands
- Simple LLM interactions
- Prototyping

### Not Suitable For
- Production use
- File creation
- Development tasks
- Any task requiring tool execution

## Method 3: CLI Mode

### Overview
Command-line interface to OpenHands with full runtime.

### Architecture
```
Your Code → CLI Command → OpenHands Runtime → CodeActAgent → Tools → LLM
                                                    ↓
                                            Bash, Files, Jupyter
```

### Capabilities
✅ **Supported:**
- Code generation
- File creation
- Bash execution
- Jupyter notebooks
- Web automation
- Full development workflows

❌ **Not Supported:**
- None (full capabilities)

### Implementation
```bash
python -m openhands.core.main \
    -t "Create a file named test.txt" \
    -c CodeActAgent \
    -i 5
```

### Performance
- **Latency:** 5-120 seconds (includes tool execution)
- **Token Usage:** 500-10000 tokens
- **Cost:** $0.01-$0.10 per task

### Capabilities
- ✅ File creation
- ✅ Bash execution
- ✅ Jupyter notebooks
- ✅ Web automation
- ✅ Full tool access
- ✅ Multi-step workflows

### Pros
- ✅ Full capabilities
- ✅ Production ready
- ✅ Supports all tools
