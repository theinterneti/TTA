## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: Use Task Complexity Routing
- **Simple tasks** → Mistral Small + Direct API (fastest)
- **Complex tasks** → DeepSeek Chat + CLI Mode (best quality)
- **Reasoning tasks** → DeepSeek R1 + Direct API (best reasoning)

### Recommendation 2: Implement Model Rotation
- Primary: Mistral Small
- Fallback 1: Llama 3.3
- Fallback 2: DeepSeek Chat
- Handles rate limiting automatically

### Recommendation 3: Use Direct API for Speed
- No container overhead
- Immediate response
- Perfect for code generation
- Sufficient for most tasks

### Recommendation 4: Use CLI Mode for Workflows
- File creation capability
- Bash execution capability
- Multi-file project support
- Worth the overhead for complex tasks

### Recommendation 5: Avoid Docker Mode (for TTA)
- Not needed for single-user system
- Adds 5-10s startup overhead
- Consider only if scaling to multi-tenant
