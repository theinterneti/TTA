# OpenHands Integration: Quick Reference Guide

**Date:** 2025-10-25
**Status:** Investigation Complete - Ready for Implementation

---

## TL;DR

**Problem:** OpenHands integration doesn't create files or execute bash commands.

**Root Cause:** Using SDK mode (limited) instead of Docker runtime mode (full capabilities).

**Solution:** Switch to Docker runtime mode.

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks to implement.

## What Works ✅

### Direct API Calls
- ✅ Code generation
- ✅ Code analysis
- ✅ Documentation writing
- ✅ Problem solving
- ✅ 100% success rate
- ✅ Fast (1-30 seconds)
- ✅ Cheap ($0.001-$0.01)

### Docker Runtime Mode
- ✅ File creation
- ✅ Bash execution
- ✅ Jupyter notebooks
- ✅ Web automation
- ✅ Full tool access
- ✅ Production ready

---

## What Doesn't Work ❌

### SDK Mode (Current)
- ❌ File creation
- ❌ Bash execution
- ❌ Tool execution
- ❌ Only 2 tools (think, finish)
- ❌ Not production ready

## Quick Comparison

| Method | File Creation | Bash | Speed | Cost | Setup |
|--------|---------------|------|-------|------|-------|
| Direct API | ❌ | ❌ | ⚡⚡⚡ | 💰 | Easy |
| SDK | ❌ | ❌ | ⚡⚡ | 💰 | Easy |
| CLI | ✅ | ✅ | ⚡ | 💰💰 | Medium |
| Docker | ✅ | ✅ | ⚡ | 💰💰 | Hard |

## Recommended Solution

**Use Docker Runtime Mode**

```python
# Enable Docker mode
config = OpenHandsIntegrationConfig.from_env()
config.use_docker_runtime = True

# Create client
client = create_openhands_client(config)

# Execute task
result = await client.execute_task("Create a file named test.txt")
```

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Verify Docker
```bash
docker --version
docker run hello-world
```

### Step 2: Update Configuration
```python
# In config.py
use_docker_runtime = True  # Changed from False
```

### Step 3: Test Docker Runtime
```bash
uv run python scripts/test_openhands_docker_runtime.py
```

### Step 4: Run Integration Tests
```bash
uv run pytest tests/integration/openhands_integration/ -v
```

### Use Direct API For:
- Code generation
- Code analysis
- Documentation
- Planning
- Quick prototyping

### Use Docker/CLI For:
- File creation
- Test generation
- Build automation
- DevOps tasks
- Full workflows

## FAQ

**Q: Why doesn't the current integration work?**
A: The SDK mode is too limited. It only has `think` and `finish` tools, no file or bash tools.

**Q: Can we fix it without Docker?**
A: No. Full capabilities require Docker runtime or CLI mode.

**Q: How long will it take to fix?**
A: 2-3 weeks for full implementation.

**Q: Will it cost more?**
A: Slightly more per task, but still very affordable ($0.01-$0.10).

**Q: Is Docker required?**
A: Yes, for full capabilities. CLI mode is an alternative.

**Q: Can we use the API for everything?**
A: No, only for code generation. File creation requires Docker/CLI.

**Q: What about the existing DockerOpenHandsClient?**
A: It already exists! We just need to enable it.

**Q: Will this break existing code?**
A: No, it's backward compatible. We can add a fallback.
