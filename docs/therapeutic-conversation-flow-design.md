# Therapeutic Conversation Flow Design

## Overview

This document defines the detailed conversation flow for therapeutic character creation, implementing progressive immersion that starts with mundane data collection and gradually transitions to deeper therapeutic engagement.

## Flow Architecture

### Core Principles
1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Information complexity increases gradually
2. **Therapeutic Safety**: Continuous monitoring for crisis indicators
3. **User Agency**: Users control pacing and depth of sharing
4. **Validation & Normalization**: Responses are acknowledged and normalized
5. **Flexibility**: Users can revisit and modify responses
6. **Contextual Adaptation**: Flow adapts based on user responses

## Conversation Stages

### Stage 1: Welcome & Connection (Mundane Level)
**Duration**: 3-5 exchanges  
**Therapeutic Goal**: Build rapport and establish safety  
**Data Collection**: Basic identity information

#### 1.1 Opening Welcome
```
Assistant: "Hello! I'm here to help you create your therapeutic companion - a character that represents you in your healing journey. This is a safe, private space where you can share as much or as little as feels comfortable. 

What would you like me to call you?"
```

**Response Handling**:
- Validate name format
- Acknowledge with warmth: "It's wonderful to meet you, [Name]."
- Check pronunciation if needed

#### 1.2 Identity Exploration
```
Assistant: "Thank you for sharing that with me, [Name]. I'm curious about how you see yourself. When you imagine yourself in your mind's eye, what stage of life are you in? Are you in your childhood years, teenage years, adult years, or perhaps your elder years?"
```

**Therapeutic Context**: "Different life stages bring unique perspectives and wisdom to our journey."

#### 1.3 Self-Image Introduction
```
Assistant: "That gives me a good sense of where you are in life. Now, can you paint me a picture of how you see yourself? What do you look like when you imagine yourself?"
```

**Follow-up Prompts**:
- "What style of clothing makes you feel most like yourself?"
- "Is there anything unique about your appearance that makes you, you?"

### Stage 2: Personal Story & Values (Transitional Level)
**Duration**: 8-12 exchanges  
**Therapeutic Goal**: Explore identity, values, and relationships  
**Data Collection**: Background, personality, relationships

#### 2.1 Story Invitation
```
Assistant: "Every person has a story that brought them to where they are today. I'd love to hear yours. What experiences have shaped who you are? You can share as much or as little as feels right."
```

**Adaptive Responses**:
- If detailed: "Thank you for trusting me with your story."
- If brief: "That's perfectly fine. Sometimes our stories unfold gradually."
- If emotional: Validate and offer support

#### 2.2 Personality Exploration
```
Assistant: "If someone who knows you well were describing you to a new friend, what would they say about your personality? What words capture who you are at your core?"
```

**Therapeutic Reframe**: "Our personality traits are like colors on a palette - each one adds richness to who we are."

#### 2.3 Values Discovery
```
Assistant: "What matters most to you in life? What principles guide your decisions when things get complicated?"
```

**Deeper Exploration**: "Understanding our values helps us make choices that align with who we truly are."

#### 2.4 Strengths Recognition
```
Assistant: "Let's focus on your strengths for a moment. What are you good at? What abilities or qualities are you proud of? Sometimes we forget to acknowledge our own gifts."
```

**Encouragement**: "These strengths will be important resources in your therapeutic journey."

#### 2.5 Relationship Mapping
```
Assistant: "Tell me about the important people in your life. Who are the relationships that matter most to you, and how do they support or challenge you?"
```

### Stage 3: Therapeutic Readiness & Goals (Therapeutic Level)
**Duration**: 10-15 exchanges  
**Therapeutic Goal**: Assess readiness and establish therapeutic framework  
**Data Collection**: Concerns, goals, preferences, therapeutic profile

#### 3.1 Transition to Therapeutic Focus
```
Assistant: "You've shared so much about who you are, and I'm grateful for your openness. Now I'd like to understand what brought you here today. What are some areas of your life where you'd like to see positive change or growth?"
```

**Normalization**: "Many people seek support for things like stress, relationships, self-confidence, life transitions, or simply wanting to understand themselves better."

#### 3.2 Concern Exploration
```
Assistant: "These concerns you've shared are completely valid and common. Can you help me understand which of these feels most important to address right now?"
```

**Validation Responses**:
- "That takes courage to acknowledge."
- "You're not alone in feeling this way."
- "Recognizing this is the first step toward change."

#### 3.3 Goal Setting
```
Assistant: "What would success look like for you in this therapeutic journey? If we were meeting six months from now and you felt this experience had been worthwhile, what changes would you notice in your life?"
```

**SMART Goal Guidance**: Help users create specific, achievable goals through gentle questioning.

#### 3.4 Therapeutic Preferences
```
Assistant: "Everyone has their own pace for growth and change. Some people prefer a gentle, supportive approach that feels safe and comfortable. Others want a balanced middle ground. And some are ready for more intensive therapeutic work that challenges them to grow quickly. What feels right for you?"
```

**Intensity Explanations**:
- **Gentle**: "Focuses on building safety, self-compassion, and gradual exploration"
- **Balanced**: "Combines support with gentle challenges for steady progress"
- **Intensive**: "Includes deeper exploration and more direct therapeutic interventions"

#### 3.5 Comfort & Challenge Assessment
```
Assistant: "What topics or activities feel safe and comfortable for you to explore? These comfort zones are important - they're your foundation for growth."
```

**Follow-up**: "Are there areas where you feel ready to be gently challenged or pushed to grow? Identifying these shows real courage."

#### 3.6 Readiness Evaluation
```
Assistant: "On a scale where you feel completely ready for change and growth, where would you place yourself today? There's no right or wrong answer - this helps me understand how to best support you."
```

## Flow Control Mechanisms

### Branching Logic
- **High Engagement**: Continue with deeper questions
- **Low Engagement**: Offer lighter alternatives or breaks
- **Emotional Distress**: Activate safety protocols
- **Resistance**: Validate and offer choice

### Safety Monitoring
- **Crisis Indicators**: Suicidal ideation, self-harm, abuse
- **Emotional Overwhelm**: Excessive distress, dissociation
- **Therapeutic Boundaries**: Inappropriate content, boundary violations

### Adaptive Responses
- **Detailed Sharers**: Acknowledge depth, ask for clarification
- **Brief Responders**: Normalize brevity, offer gentle prompts
- **Emotional Responses**: Validate feelings, offer support
- **Resistant Users**: Respect boundaries, offer alternatives

### Progress Indicators
- Visual progress bar showing conversation stages
- Gentle reminders: "We're about halfway through our conversation"
- Completion estimates: "Just a few more questions to go"

## Conversation Completion

### Summary & Validation
```
Assistant: "Thank you for sharing so openly with me. Let me reflect back what I've learned about you to make sure I understand correctly..."
```

### Character Preview
- Show assembled character profile
- Allow modifications
- Confirm therapeutic goals and preferences

### Final Confirmation
```
Assistant: "This is the therapeutic companion we've created together. Does this feel like an authentic representation of you and your goals? You can always make changes later as you grow and learn more about yourself."
```
