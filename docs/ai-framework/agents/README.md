## Agent Types

The TTA project uses several types of agents:

### World Builder Agent (WBA)

The World Builder Agent is responsible for:
- Creating and maintaining the game world
- Generating locations, objects, and characters
- Managing the state of the game world

### Input Processor Agent (IPA)

The Input Processor Agent is responsible for:
- Processing user input
- Determining user intent
- Identifying entities and actions

### Narrative Generator Agent (NGA)

The Narrative Generator Agent is responsible for:
- Generating narrative responses
- Creating engaging and therapeutic content
- Maintaining narrative consistency

## Agent Communication

Agents communicate with each other through:
- Shared state
- Message passing
- Event-driven architecture

## Agent Implementation

Agents are implemented using:
- LangGraph for agent workflows
- Large Language Models (LLMs) for agent reasoning
- Dynamic Tool System for agent capabilities
