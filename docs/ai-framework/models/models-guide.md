# TTA Models Guide

## Overview

The Therapeutic Text Adventure (TTA) project uses multiple AI models for different tasks. This guide documents the models used, their characteristics, and how they are integrated into the system.

## Model Selection Strategy

The TTA project employs a sophisticated model selection strategy that balances performance, resource usage, and task requirements. The strategy includes:

- **Task-Based Selection**: Different models are selected based on the specific task requirements
- **Resource Constraints**: Models are selected based on available memory, CPU, and GPU resources
- **Performance Metrics**: Models are evaluated based on speed, accuracy, and quality metrics
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Fallback models are used when primary models are unavailable or fail

## Core Models

The TTA project uses the following core models:

### Large Language Models (LLMs)

| Model | Size | Quantization | Use Cases | Strengths |
|-------|------|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Mistral 7B | 7B | 4-bit | General text generation, reasoning | Good balance of performance and resource usage |
| Qwen 1.5B | 1.5B | 4-bit | Fast responses, memory-constrained environments | Very fast, low memory usage |
| Llama 3 8B | 8B | 4-bit | Complex reasoning, creative content | Strong reasoning capabilities |
| Gemma 2B | 2B | 4-bit | Balanced performance | Good all-around performance |

### Embedding Models

| Model | Dimensions | Use Cases | Strengths |
|-------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | 384 | General embeddings, similarity search | Fast, compact |
| e5-small-v2 | 384 | Semantic search | Good semantic understanding |
| bge-small-en-v1.5 | 384 | Knowledge retrieval | Strong retrieval performance |

## Task-Specific Optimizations

Different tasks in the TTA project require different model configurations:

### Text Generation

- **Creative Content**: Higher temperature (0.7-1.0), larger models
- **Structured Output**: Lower temperature (0.1-0.3), models with good JSON capabilities
- **Dialogue**: Balanced temperature (0.5-0.7), models fine-tuned for conversation

### Knowledge Retrieval

- **Factual Queries**: Embedding models optimized for retrieval
- **Contextual Understanding**: Models with strong context window capabilities
- **Specialized Knowledge**: Domain-specific embeddings when available

## Hybrid Model Approach

The TTA project uses a hybrid model approach that combines:

1. **Multiple Model Types**: LLMs, embedding models, and specialized models
2. **Model Chaining**: Output from one model feeds into another
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combining outputs from multiple models
4. **Task Delegation**: Routing tasks to the most appropriate model

## Performance Monitoring

The TTA project includes comprehensive performance monitoring:

- **Speed Metrics**: Tokens per second, response time
- **Memory Usage**: RAM and VRAM consumption
- **Quality Metrics**: Response quality, error rates
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, GPU, and memory utilization

## Model Fallback Mechanisms

To ensure robustness, the TTA project implements fallback mechanisms:

1. **Graceful Degradation**: Falling back to smaller models when resources are constrained
2. **Error Recovery**: Retrying with alternative models when errors occur
3. **Timeout Handling**: Using faster models when response time is critical
4. **Offline Capabilities**: Local models when cloud services are unavailable

## Future Model Integration

The TTA project is designed to easily integrate new models:

- **Modular Architecture**: New models can be added without changing the core system
- **Evaluation Framework**: New models can be evaluated against existing models
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular updates to incorporate state-of-the-art models
- **Custom Fine-Tuning**: Capability to fine-tune models for specific tasks

## Model Testing

The TTA project includes comprehensive model testing frameworks:

- **Enhanced Model Testing**: Tests models with different configurations
- **Asynchronous Model Testing**: Tests multiple models in parallel
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Standardized benchmarks for comparing models
- **Task-Specific Evaluation**: Evaluation metrics tailored to specific tasks

For detailed information on model testing, see the [Model Testing Guide](model-testing.md).

## Conclusion

The TTA project's model strategy balances performance, resource usage, and task requirements to provide the best possible experience. By using a combination of models and sophisticated selection strategies, the system can adapt to different scenarios and provide high-quality responses while managing resource constraints.
