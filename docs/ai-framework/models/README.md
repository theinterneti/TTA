# TTA AI Framework Models

## Overview

This directory contains documentation for the AI models used in the TTA project, including model selection strategy, model testing, and model integration.

## Contents

1. [Models Guide](models-guide.md): Comprehensive guide to the models used in the TTA project
2. [Model Testing](model-testing.md): Guide to the model testing frameworks used in the TTA project
3. [Model Selection Strategy](model-selection-strategy.md): Detailed information about the model selection strategy
4. [Hybrid Model Approach](hybrid-model-approach.md): Information about the hybrid model approach used in the TTA project

## Model Categories

The TTA project uses several categories of models:

### Large Language Models (LLMs)

These models are used for text generation, reasoning, and dialogue:

- Mistral 7B
- Qwen 1.5B
- Llama 3 8B
- Gemma 2B

### Embedding Models

These models are used for semantic search and knowledge retrieval:

- all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- e5-small-v2
- bge-small-en-v1.5

### Specialized Models

These models are used for specific tasks:

- Structured output generation
- Tool use
- Creative content generation
- Complex reasoning

## Model Selection

The TTA project uses a sophisticated model selection strategy that balances:

- Task requirements
- Resource constraints
- Performance metrics
- Quality requirements

For more information, see the [Model Selection Strategy](model-selection-strategy.md) document.

## Model Testing

The TTA project includes comprehensive model testing frameworks:

- Enhanced Model Testing
- Asynchronous Model Testing
- Performance Benchmarks
- Task-Specific Evaluation

For more information, see the [Model Testing](model-testing.md) document.
