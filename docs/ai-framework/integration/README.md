# TTA AI Libraries Integration

## Overview

This directory contains documentation for the integration of AI libraries in the TTA project, including library comparison, integration plan, and implementation details.

## Contents

1. [AI Libraries Comparison](libraries-comparison.md): Comparison of AI libraries used in the TTA project
2. [AI Libraries Integration Plan](libraries-integration-plan.md): Plan for integrating AI libraries
3. [Transformers Integration](transformers-integration.md): Information about the integration of the Transformers library
4. [LangGraph Integration](langgraph-integration.md): Information about the integration of the LangGraph library

## Integrated Libraries

The TTA project integrates several AI libraries:

### Transformers

The Transformers library is used for:
- Loading and running language models
- Text generation
- Embeddings generation

### LangGraph

The LangGraph library is used for:
- Creating agent workflows
- Managing agent state
- Coordinating agent communication

### LangChain

The LangChain library is used for:
- Document processing
- Vector database integration
- Tool integration

### Other Libraries

Other libraries integrated in the TTA project include:
- Pydantic for data validation
- FastAPI for API development
- Neo4j for graph database
- FAISS for vector search

## Integration Strategy

The TTA project uses a modular integration strategy that:
- Abstracts library-specific code
- Provides consistent interfaces
- Allows for easy library swapping
- Manages dependencies efficiently
