# Integrated Development Workflow Design

**Date:** 2025-10-20  
**Status:** Design Phase  
**Version:** 1.0

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines a comprehensive, automated development workflow that integrates all three Phase 1 agentic primitives (AI Context Management, Error Recovery, Development Observability) with TTA's existing component maturity workflow to create a reliable pipeline from specification to production deployment.

**Key Innovation:** Zero-manual-intervention automation with complete observability, resilient error handling, and AI-assisted continuity across multi-session development.

## Architecture Overview

### Workflow Stages

```
Specification → Implementation → Testing → Refactoring → Staging → Production
     ↓              ↓              ↓           ↓           ↓          ↓
  Context7      AI Context     Observ.    Error Rec.   Quality    Maturity
  Retrieval     Tracking       Metrics    + Retry      Gates      Criteria
```

### Primitive Integration

| Primitive | Integration Points | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| **AI Context Management** | All stages | Track decisions, maintain continuity across sessions |
| **Error Recovery** | Testing, Staging, Production | Retry transient failures, circuit breaker for persistent issues |
| **Development Observability** | All stages | Track execution time, success rates, identify bottlenecks |

## Workflow Stages Detail

### Stage 1: Specification → Implementation

**Inputs:**
- Specification document (markdown)

**Process:**
1. Parse specification document

- Deployment metrics
- Updated AI context

**Quality Gates:**
- Coverage ≥70% (unit tests)
- All unit tests passing

---

### Stage 5: Staging → Production

**Inputs:**
- Staging deployment
- 7-day stability metrics
- Integration test results

**Process:**
1. Validate all staging→production criteria met
2. Run E2E tests with error recovery
3. Deploy to production with retry and rollback capability
4. Track production deployment metrics
5. Update AI context with production status (importance=1.0)

**Outputs:**
- Production deployment
- E2E test results
- Production metrics
- Final AI context summary

**Quality Gates:**
- Coverage ≥80% (integration tests)
- All integration tests passing
- Performance meets SLAs
- Security review complete
- 7-day uptime ≥99.5%
- Monitoring configured
- Rollback procedure tested

## Quality Gate Framework

### Quality Gate Validator

Each quality gate is a Python function that returns:
```python
@dataclass
class QualityGateResult:
    passed: bool
    gate_name: str
    details: dict[str, Any]
    errors: list[str]
    warnings: list[str]
```

### Quality Gate Categories

1. **Testing Gates**
   - All tests pass
   - Coverage thresholds met
   - No flaky tests

2. **Code Quality Gates**
   - Linting passes (ruff)
   - Type checking passes (pyright)
   - Complexity acceptable (radon)

3. **Security Gates**
   - No secrets detected (detect-secrets)
   - No critical vulnerabilities (bandit)
   - Dependencies up-to-date

4. **Performance Gates**
   - Response time acceptable
   - Memory usage acceptable
   - No performance regressions

5. **Documentation Gates**
   - README complete
   - API documentation complete
   - Usage examples provided

## Error Recovery Strategy

### Retry Configuration by Stage

| Stage | Max Retries | Base Delay | Exponential Base | Max Delay |
|-------|-------------|------------|------------------|-----------|
| Testing | 3 | 1s | 2.0 | 10s |
| Staging Deploy | 5 | 2s | 2.0 | 30s |
| Production Deploy | 3 | 5s | 1.5 | 60s |

### Circuit Breaker Configuration

- **Failure Threshold:** 5 consecutive failures
- **Recovery Timeout:** 60 seconds
- **Half-Open Test:** Single request

### Fallback Strategies

1. **Test Failures:** Retry with isolated test execution
2. **Deployment Failures:** Rollback to previous version
3. **Quality Gate Failures:** Generate detailed error report

---

## Observability Framework

### Metrics Collected

**Per Stage:**
- Execution time
- Success/failure rate
- Retry count
- Error types

**Per Quality Gate:**
- Pass/fail status
- Execution time
- Threshold values
- Actual values

**Overall Workflow:**
- Total execution time
- Stage-by-stage breakdown
- Bottleneck identification
- Historical trends

### Dashboard Views

1. **Workflow Overview**
   - Current stage
   - Overall progress
   - Estimated completion time

2. **Quality Gates**
   - Gate status (pass/fail)
   - Historical pass rates
   - Common failure reasons

3. **Performance**
   - Stage execution times
   - Retry statistics
   - Bottleneck analysis

---

## AI Context Management Strategy

### Session Structure

```
Session: component-name-YYYY-MM-DD
Messages:
  - System: Architecture context
  - User: Specification summary (importance=1.0)
  - User: Implementation decisions (importance=1.0)
  - User: Test results (importance=0.9)
  - User: Refactoring decisions (importance=0.7)
  - User: Deployment status (importance=0.9)
  - User: Production status (importance=1.0)
```

### Importance Scoring

- **1.0:** Architectural decisions, requirements, production status
- **0.9:** Implementation completion, test results, deployment status
- **0.7:** Refactoring decisions, optimization choices
- **0.5:** General progress updates

### Session Lifecycle

1. **Create:** At specification parsing
2. **Update:** After each stage completion
3. **Save:** After each significant decision
4. **Load:** When resuming multi-session development
5. **Archive:** After production deployment
