# TTA Component Maturity Workflow

## Overview

The TTA Component Maturity Workflow is a systematic process for promoting components through maturity stages aligned with our environment-based organization (Development ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Production). This workflow ensures components meet quality, performance, and reliability standards before advancing to production.

## Promotion Process

### Step 1: Prepare for Promotion

1. **Review Maturity Criteria**: Check the component's MATURITY.md file
2. **Verify Exit Criteria**: Ensure all criteria for the target stage are met
3. **Resolve Blockers**: Address any open blocker issues
4. **Update Documentation**: Ensure all documentation is current
5. **Run Tests**: Verify all tests pass

### Step 2: Create Promotion Request

1. Navigate to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/theinterneti/TTA/issues/new/choose)
2. Select **"üöÄ Component Promotion Request"** template
3. Fill out all required fields:
   - Component name
   - Current stage
   - Target stage
   - Functional group
   - Promotion justification
   - Criteria checklist
   - Test results
   - Performance metrics (if applicable)
   - Security review results
   - Documentation links
   - Dependencies
   - Known blockers
   - Rollback plan (for production promotion)
4. Submit the issue

### Step 3: Automated Validation

The CI/CD system will automatically:
1. Run component-specific tests
2. Check code quality (linting, type checking)
3. Perform security scans
4. Validate test coverage
5. Generate promotion report
6. Post results as issue comment

### Step 4: Review and Approval

1. **Self-Review**: Review the automated validation results
2. **Address Issues**: Fix any issues identified by automation
3. **Manual Review**: Perform manual review of criteria
4. **Approval**: Label issue with `promotion:approved` when ready

### Step 5: Execute Promotion

1. **Update Environment**: Deploy component to target environment
2. **Update MATURITY.md**: Update component's maturity status
3. **Update GitHub Project**: Move component to target stage column
4. **Close Promotion Issue**: Label with `promotion:completed` and close
5. **Create Milestone**: Create milestone for next promotion (if applicable)

### Step 6: Post-Promotion Monitoring

1. **Monitor Health**: Watch component health metrics
2. **Track Performance**: Ensure performance meets SLAs
3. **Address Issues**: Quickly address any post-promotion issues
4. **Document Lessons**: Update promotion guide with lessons learned

## Tracking Component Maturity

### GitHub Project Board

**Project**: [TTA Component Maturity Tracker](https://github.com/users/theinterneti/projects/)

**Views**:
- **Board View**: Visual kanban board showing components in each stage
- **Table View**: Detailed table with all component metadata
- **Roadmap View**: Timeline showing component progression

**Custom Fields**:
- Functional Group
- Current Stage
- Target Stage
- Promotion Blocker Count
- Test Coverage
- Last Updated
- Owner
- Priority
- Dependencies

### Component MATURITY.md Files

Each component has a `MATURITY.md` file tracking:
- Current maturity stage
- Promotion criteria status
- Promotion history
- Current blockers
- Dependencies

**Location**: `src/components/<component-name>/MATURITY.md`

### GitHub Labels

**Component Labels**: Identify which component (e.g., `component:neo4j`)

**Target Labels**: Identify promotion target (e.g., `target:staging`)

**Promotion Labels**: Track promotion workflow status (e.g., `promotion:requested`)

**Blocker Labels**: Identify blocker types (e.g., `blocker:tests`)

## Best Practices

### 1. Incremental Promotion
- Promote components incrementally, not all at once
- Validate each promotion before proceeding to the next

### 2. Dependency Management
- Ensure dependencies are at equal or higher maturity stage
- Promote dependencies before dependent components

### 3. Documentation First
- Update documentation before requesting promotion
- Ensure documentation is accurate and complete

### 4. Test Coverage
- Maintain high test coverage throughout development
- Add tests before promotion, not after

### 5. Performance Validation
- Establish performance baselines early
- Validate performance before production promotion

### 6. Security Review
- Perform security reviews regularly, not just before promotion
- Address security issues promptly

### 7. Rollback Planning
- Document rollback procedures before production promotion
- Test rollback procedures in staging

### 8. Monitoring Setup
- Configure monitoring before promotion
- Ensure alerts are properly configured

## FAQ

### Q: Can components skip stages?
**A**: No. Components must progress through all stages sequentially (Development ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Production).

### Q: Can components be demoted?
**A**: Yes. If a component fails to meet maintenance criteria, it can be demoted to a lower stage for remediation.

### Q: How long should a component stay in staging?
**A**: Minimum 7 days for reliability validation. Longer for complex components.

### Q: What if a component has no dependencies?
**A**: Core Infrastructure components typically have no dependencies and can be promoted independently.

### Q: Can multiple components be promoted together?
**A**: Yes, if they are tightly coupled and tested together. However, incremental promotion is recommended.
