## Part 1: Key Concepts from GitHub Blog

### 1.1 Agentic Primitives (GitHub's Definition)

**Definition:** Simple, reusable files or modules that provide specific capabilities or rules for AI agents.

**Core Primitives:**

1. **Instructions Files** (`.instructions.md`)
   - Structured guidance for AI agents
   - Modular, targeted scope
   - Repository-specific preferences
   - Example: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

2. **Chat Modes** (`.chatmode.md`)
   - Role-based expertise (architect, backend-dev, frontend-dev)
   - MCP tool boundaries for security
   - Domain-specific focus
   - Example: `backend-engineer.chatmode.md`

3. **Agentic Workflows** (`.prompt.md`)
   - Reusable prompts with built-in validation
   - Orchestrate multiple primitives
   - Designed for local or delegated execution
   - Example: `feature-spec.prompt.md`

4. **Specification Files** (`.spec.md`)
   - Implementation-ready blueprints
   - Ensure repeatable results
   - Bridge planning and implementation
   - Example: Feature specifications

5. **Agent Memory Files** (`.memory.md`)
   - Preserve knowledge across sessions
   - Document implementation failures/successes
   - Capture patterns and decisions
   - Example: Project-specific learnings

6. **Context Helper Files** (`.context.md`)
   - Optimize information retrieval
   - Reduce cognitive load
   - Accelerate context loading
   - Example: API documentation references

---

### 1.2 Context Engineering (GitHub's Definition)

**Definition:** Strategic management of AI context to ensure agents focus on relevant information within memory constraints.

**Key Techniques:**

1. **Session Splitting**
   - Distinct sessions for different phases (planning, implementation, testing)
   - Fresh context windows for complex tasks
   - Better focus and accuracy

2. **Modular Instructions**
   - Apply only relevant instructions via `applyTo` YAML frontmatter
   - Preserve context space for actual work
   - Reduce irrelevant suggestions

3. **Memory-Driven Development**
   - Leverage `.memory.md` files for project knowledge
   - Maintain decisions across sessions
   - Compound intelligence through iteration

4. **Context Optimization**
   - Use `.context.md` files strategically
   - Accelerate information retrieval
   - Reduce cognitive load

5. **Cognitive Focus Optimization**
   - Use chat modes to maintain domain focus
   - Prevent cross-domain interference
   - Less context pollution = more consistent outputs

---

### 1.3 Recommended Patterns & Best Practices

**Markdown Prompt Engineering:**
- **Context loading:** Use links as context injection points
- **Structured thinking:** Headers and bullets for clear reasoning
- **Role activation:** "You are an expert [role]" triggers specialized knowledge
- **Tool integration:** `Use MCP tool tool-name` for controlled execution
- **Precise language:** Eliminate ambiguity
- **Validation gates:** "Stop and get user approval" for human oversight

**Agentic Workflow Design:**
- Build in mandatory human reviews
- Create validation checkpoints
- Design for both local execution and delegation
- Use semantic structure for predictability

**Specification-Driven Development:**
- Standardize planning-to-implementation process
- Provide blueprints for deterministic handoff
- Split specs into implementation-ready tasks
- Use tools like `spec-kit` for consistency

└── component-failures.memory.md    # Failed approaches to avoid
```

**Example: `workflow-learnings.memory.md`**
```markdown
# Workflow Learnings

## 2025-10-20: Test Discovery Enhancement
**Problem:** Quality gates looked for `tests/orchestration/` but tests were at `tests/test_orchestrator.py`

**Solution:** Enhanced test discovery to support naming variations (orchestration → orchestrator)

**Pattern:** Always check for multiple naming patterns:
- Directory-based: `tests/<component>/`
- Single file: `tests/test_<component>.py`
- Pattern-based: `tests/test_<component>_*.py`
- Name variations: Handle suffix changes (-ion → -or)

**Impact:** Workflow now handles flexible test organization
