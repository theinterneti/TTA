## Component Maturity Status

### Current Stage Distribution

| Stage | Components | Percentage |
|-------|------------|------------|
| Development | 12 | 100% |
| Staging | 0 | 0% |
| Production | 0 | 0% |

**All components are currently in Development stage**

---

### Promotion Readiness Assessment

**Ready for Staging Promotion** (with work): 0 components

**Blockers Identified**:
- Test coverage insufficient (all components)
- Documentation incomplete (all components)
- Integration tests missing (most components)
- Performance validation needed (AI/Agent systems)
- Clinical validation needed (Therapeutic Content)

**First Promotion Candidates** (after addressing blockers):
1. Neo4j (Core Infrastructure)
2. Docker (Core Infrastructure)
3. Model Management (AI/Agent Systems)

---

## Dependency Analysis

### Dependency Layers

**Layer 1: Core Infrastructure** (No dependencies)
- Neo4j
- Docker
- Carbon

**Layer 2: AI/Agent Systems Foundation** (Depends on Layer 1)
- Model Management

**Layer 3: AI/Agent Systems** (Depends on Layers 1-2)
- LLM → Model Management
- Agent Orchestration → LLM, Model Management
- Narrative Arc Orchestrator → Neo4j, LLM, Narrative Coherence

**Layer 4: Player Experience & Therapeutic Content** (Depends on Layers 1-3)
- Narrative Coherence → Neo4j, Narrative Arc Orchestrator
- Gameplay Loop → Neo4j, Narrative Arc Orchestrator, Therapeutic Systems
- Character Arc Manager → Neo4j, LLM, Narrative Arc Orchestrator
- Player Experience → Neo4j, Gameplay Loop, Agent Orchestration
- Therapeutic Systems → Neo4j, Narrative Coherence, Gameplay Loop

**Promotion Order**: Must follow dependency layers (Layer 1 → Layer 2 → Layer 3 → Layer 4)

## Verification

### MATURITY.md Files Verification

```bash
# Count MATURITY.md files
find src/components -name "MATURITY.md" | wc -l
# Expected: 12

# List all MATURITY.md files
find src/components -name "MATURITY.md"
```

### Component Inventory Verification

```bash
# Verify inventory document exists
ls -la docs/development/COMPONENT_INVENTORY.md

# Verify scripts exist and are executable
ls -la scripts/create-component-maturity-files.sh
ls -la scripts/add-components-to-project.sh
```

## Next Steps: Phase 4 - CI/CD Integration

**Objective**: Integrate component maturity workflow with CI/CD pipelines

**Tasks**:
1. Create `component-promotion-validation.yml` workflow
2. Enhance existing workflows with component-specific checks
3. Add promotion criteria validation
4. Implement automated labeling
5. Create promotion status reports

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

---

## Manual Steps Required

### 1. Create GitHub Project Board

**Action**: Follow the guide in `docs/development/GITHUB_PROJECT_SETUP.md`

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to https://github.com/users/theinterneti/projects
2. Create new project: "TTA Component Maturity Tracker"
3. Configure Board, Table, and Roadmap views
4. Add custom fields (9 fields)
5. Configure automation

**Estimated Time**: 15-20 minutes

---

### 2. Add Components to Project

**Action**: Run `scripts/add-components-to-project.sh` and follow instructions

**Steps**:
1. Run the script
2. Create the GitHub Project (if not already done)
3. Add all 12 components to the project
4. Configure custom fields for each component
5. Create promotion milestones

**Estimated Time**: 30-45 minutes

---

### 3. Review and Customize MATURITY.md Files

**Action**: Review each component's MATURITY.md file and customize

**Steps**:
1. Open each MATURITY.md file
2. Update component-specific information:
   - Purpose and key features
   - Dependencies
   - Current test coverage
   - Known blockers
   - Performance metrics
3. Save changes

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours (15 minutes per component)
