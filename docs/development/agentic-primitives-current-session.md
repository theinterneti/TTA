# Agentic Primitives - Current Session Guide

**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Session**: 1.5 - Add Instruction Validation (COMPLETE ✅)
**Phase**: Phase 1 - Foundation (COMPLETE ✅)
**Actual Time**: ~2 hours

## Session Overview

This was the **final implementation session** for Phase 1 of the agentic primitives integration. The goal was to create a quality gate that validates `.instructions.md` files to ensure they're well-formed and complete before use in AI agent context.

**What Was Built**: `InstructionsValidationGate` quality gate
**Why It Matters**: Validation ensures instruction files are well-formed and complete, preventing runtime errors and ensuring consistency across the codebase.

## Phase 1 Complete ✅

## Reference Materials

### Existing TTA Standards

**Architecture**:
- `src/agent_orchestration/PHASE1_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Layered architecture example
- `docs/architecture/monorepo-restructuring-summary.md` - Package organization

**Testing**:
- `tests/` - Existing test files for patterns
- `.augment/rules/integrated-workflow.md` - Quality gate thresholds

**Code Style**:
- `.augment/rules/avoid-long-files.md` - File size limits, SOLID principles
- `pyproject.toml` - ruff and pyright configuration

### Templates and Examples

**Template**: `.augment/instructions/templates/instruction.template.md`

**Example YAML Frontmatter**:
```yaml
---
applyTo: ["**/*.py"]
priority: high
category: global
---
```

**Example Architecture Principle**:
```markdown
## Architecture Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Each class/function should have one reason to change.

**Example**:
```python
# Good: Single responsibility
class PlayerStateRepository:
    """Handles player state persistence in Redis."""
    def save_state(self, player_id: str, state: dict) -> None:
        ...

class PlayerStateValidator:
    """Validates player state data."""
    def validate(self, state: dict) -> bool:
        ...
```

**Anti-Pattern**:
```python
# Bad: Multiple responsibilities
class PlayerStateManager:
    """Handles both persistence AND validation."""
    def save_state(self, player_id: str, state: dict) -> None:
        if not self.validate(state):  # Mixing concerns
            raise ValueError("Invalid state")
        ...

    def validate(self, state: dict) -> bool:
        ...
```
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: YAML frontmatter won't parse

**Solution**: Ensure frontmatter is enclosed in `---` delimiters:
```yaml
---
applyTo: ["**/*.py"]
priority: high
category: global
---
```

### Issue: File too long (>200 lines)

**Solution**: Focus on most important patterns, move detailed examples to component-specific instructions.

### Issue: Conflicts with existing `.augment/rules/*.md`

**Solution**: Cross-reference and ensure consistency. If conflict exists, document rationale for difference.

### Issue: Not sure what to include

**Solution**: Review existing code in `src/` and `tests/` for common patterns. Focus on patterns that appear in multiple components.
