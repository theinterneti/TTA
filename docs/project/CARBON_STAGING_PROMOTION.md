## 🔄 Changes Made for Promotion

### Tests Added
- `test_carbon_decorator()`: Tests decorator functionality
- `test_carbon_without_codecarbon()`: Tests graceful degradation when codecarbon unavailable

### Code Quality Fixes

- Replaced `open()` with `Path.write_text()`
- Removed unnecessary variable assignment
- Removed unused `os` import
- Fixed constant redefinition (`CODECARBON_AVAILABLE` → `codecarbon_available`)
- Fixed TypeVar usage in `track_function()` signature

### Documentation Updates
- Updated `src/components/carbon/MATURITY.md` to reflect staging status
- Created promotion documentation
- Updated promotion history

## 🚀 Post-Promotion Actions

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Deploy to Staging Environment**
   - [ ] Configure staging-specific environment variables
   - [ ] Deploy Carbon component to staging infrastructure
   - [ ] Verify deployment successful

2. **Configure Staging Settings**
   - [ ] Set `carbon.output_dir` for staging environment
   - [ ] Configure `carbon.project_name` (e.g., "TTA-Staging")
   - [ ] Set appropriate `carbon.log_level` for staging
   - [ ] Configure `carbon.measurement_interval`

3. **Set Up Monitoring**
   - [ ] Configure health check endpoints
   - [ ] Set up emissions tracking monitoring
   - [ ] Configure alerting for component failures
   - [ ] Set up logging aggregation

4. **Validate Functionality**
   - [ ] Run integration tests in staging
   - [ ] Verify emissions tracking works
   - [ ] Test decorator functionality
   - [ ] Verify graceful degradation (without codecarbon)
   - [ ] Check file output to staging directory

5. **Document Deployment**
   - [ ] Document staging deployment process
   - [ ] Create runbook for staging operations
   - [ ] Document rollback procedure
   - [ ] Update staging environment documentation

## 🏗️ Staging Environment Readiness

### Infrastructure Requirements

**Carbon Component Needs**:
- Python 3.12+ runtime
- codecarbon library installed
- Write access to emissions output directory
- Sufficient disk space for emissions logs

**Staging Environment Setup**:
```bash
# 1. Ensure staging environment exists
# Check: tta.dev/staging/ or equivalent

# 2. Install dependencies
uv sync

# 3. Configure environment
export CARBON_OUTPUT_DIR="/path/to/staging/logs/codecarbon"
export CARBON_PROJECT_NAME="TTA-Staging"
export CARBON_LOG_LEVEL="info"

# 4. Create output directory
mkdir -p $CARBON_OUTPUT_DIR

# 5. Verify component loads
python -c "from src.components.carbon_component import CarbonComponent; print('✅ Carbon component loaded')"

# 6. Run health check
# (Add health check script here)
```

### Staging-Specific Configuration

**File**: `config/staging.yaml` (or equivalent)
```yaml
carbon:
  output_dir: "/var/log/tta/staging/codecarbon"
  project_name: "TTA-Staging"
  log_level: "info"
  measurement_interval: 15
```
