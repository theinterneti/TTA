## Coverage Improvement Journey

### Initial State (2025-10-13 Morning)
- **Reported Coverage**: 70.3% (GitHub Issue #42 - could not be reproduced)
- **Measured Coverage**: 63.77% (all tests)
- **Gap to Target**: 6.23 percentage points (~24 statements)

### Investigation Phase
- Identified coverage discrepancy between reported (70.3%) and measured (63.77%)
- Discovered 3 test files exercising the component (not just 1)
- Analyzed uncovered code paths in 3 key files:
  - `scale_manager.py`: 57.01% → target 70%+
  - `causal_graph.py`: 42.86% → target 70%+
  - `impact_analysis.py`: 61.07% → target 70%+

### Implementation Phase (4-6 hours)
Created 3 new test files with 57 comprehensive tests:

1. **`tests/test_scale_manager_coverage.py`** (20 tests)
   - Conflict resolution (priority ordering, exception handling, None resolutions)
   - Base magnitude calculation (all choice types, all scales, None metadata)
   - Affected elements identification (all scales, character/location metadata)
   - Temporal decay calculation (all scales)

2. **`tests/test_causal_graph_coverage.py`** (15 tests)
   - Cycle detection (bidirectional, multiple nodes, complex graphs)
   - Weak link removal (single/multiple destinations, empty sets)
   - Edge addition (new/existing sources, duplicates)

3. **`tests/test_impact_analysis_coverage.py`** (22 tests)
   - Null checks for all functions
   - Edge cases (None metadata, various therapeutic themes, evidence/ambiguity)
   - All choice types and scales

### Final State (2025-10-13 Afternoon)
- **Final Coverage**: 86.64%
- **Coverage Improvement**: +22.87 percentage points (from 63.77%)
- **Total Tests**: 75 (14 original + 2 + 2 + 57 new)
- **Test Pass Rate**: 100%

## Next Steps: Staging Deployment

### 1. Deploy to Staging Environment

```bash
# Navigate to staging directory
cd tta.staging/

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Deploy Narrative Arc Orchestrator
./scripts/deploy-component.sh narrative_arc_orchestrator

# Verify deployment
./scripts/health-check.sh narrative_arc_orchestrator
```

### 2. Begin 7-Day Observation Period

**Monitoring Checklist**:
- [ ] Component health checks passing
- [ ] No errors in logs
- [ ] Integration with dependent components working
- [ ] Performance metrics within acceptable ranges
- [ ] No memory leaks or resource issues

**Daily Tasks**:
- Review logs for errors/warnings
- Check health check status
- Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory)
- Verify integration points

### 3. Production Promotion Criteria

After successful 7-day observation period in staging:

- [ ] Integration tests passing (≥80% coverage)
- [ ] Performance validated (meets defined SLAs)
- [ ] Security review completed, no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] 7-day uptime in staging ≥99.5%
- [ ] Complete user documentation, API reference, troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Health checks, metrics, alerts configured
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented and tested
- [ ] Handles expected production load (if applicable)

1. ✅ All staging promotion criteria met (9/9)
2. ✅ Coverage exceeds target by 16.64 percentage points (86.64% vs 70%)
3. ✅ All quality checks passing (linting, type checking, security)
4. ✅ 100% test pass rate (75/75 tests)
5. ✅ All blockers resolved
6. ✅ Documentation complete and up-to-date
7. ✅ No known issues or risks

**Risk Assessment**: LOW
- Component is self-contained (no external dependencies)
- Comprehensive test coverage validates functionality
- All code quality checks passing
- Clear rollback procedure available

**Timeline**: Ready for immediate deployment
**Target Observation Period**: 7 days (2025-10-13 to 2025-10-20)
**Target Production Promotion**: 2025-10-21 (pending successful observation)
