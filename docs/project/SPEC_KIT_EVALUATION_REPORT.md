# Spec-Kit Evaluation Report

**Date:** 2025-10-21  
**Purpose:** Evaluate spec-kit alternatives before implementing custom Gemini-powered tooling  
**Decision Context:** 5-7 hour investment in test generation, requirements extraction, and enhanced pre-commit hooks

---

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation:** **PROCEED WITH ORIGINAL PLAN** (Custom Gemini-powered tools)

**Rationale:**
- Spec-kit tools are **specification-driven development frameworks**, not test generation or requirements extraction tools
- **No overlap** with our planned improvements (test generation from existing code, requirements extraction, enhanced pre-commit hooks)
- Spec-kit assumes **greenfield development** (new features), we need **brownfield refactoring** (rewriting existing components)
- **Different problem domain:** Spec-kit generates code from specs; we need to extract specs from code
- **Integration complexity** would exceed 5-7 hour budget with minimal benefit

## Detailed Analysis

### What Spec-Kit IS

**Core Functionality:**
1. **Specification Creation** - Transform natural language into structured specs
2. **Implementation Planning** - Generate technical plans from specs
3. **Task Generation** - Break down specs into executable tasks
4. **Code Generation** - Generate code from specifications using AI
5. **Quality Gates** - Enforce quality standards during development
6. **CI/CD Integration** - Automate spec-driven workflows

**Workflow:**
```bash
# Spec-Kit workflow (greenfield)
/speckit.specify "Build a task management app..."  # Create spec
/speckit.plan "Use React, Node.js, PostgreSQL"    # Generate plan
/speckit.tasks                                     # Generate tasks
/speckit.implement                                 # Generate code
```

**Key Insight:** Spec-Kit is a **forward-engineering tool** (spec → code)

---

### What Spec-Kit IS NOT

**NOT a requirements extraction tool:**
- ❌ Does not analyze existing code to extract requirements
- ❌ Does not generate functional inventories from codebases
- ❌ Does not discover edge cases from existing implementations
- ❌ Does not create feature parity checklists

**NOT a test generation tool:**
- ❌ Does not generate tests from existing code
- ❌ Does not analyze existing code to create test cases
- ❌ Does not extract test scenarios from implementations
- ❌ Generates tests for NEW code it creates, not existing code

**NOT a refactoring tool:**
- ❌ Does not support brownfield rewrites
- ❌ Does not help migrate existing code to new implementations
- ❌ Does not preserve existing functionality during rewrites

**Key Insight:** Spec-Kit is for **greenfield development**, not **brownfield refactoring**

## Overlap Analysis

### Our Planned Improvements vs. Spec-Kit Capabilities

| Our Need | Spec-Kit Capability | Overlap | Gap |
|----------|---------------------|---------|-----|
| **Test generation from existing code** | Generates tests for NEW code it creates | ❌ **0%** | Spec-Kit doesn't analyze existing code |
| **Requirements extraction from existing code** | Creates specs from natural language | ❌ **0%** | Spec-Kit doesn't reverse-engineer code |
| **Enhanced pre-commit hooks** | Quality gates for generated code | ⚠️ **10%** | Different enforcement point (generation vs. commit) |
| **Feature parity validation** | Checklist generation for new features | ❌ **0%** | Spec-Kit doesn't compare old vs. new |
| **Side-by-side testing** | Integration testing for new code | ❌ **0%** | Spec-Kit doesn't support migration testing |

**Total Overlap:** **~2%** (minimal quality gate concepts only)

---

## Use Case Mismatch

### Our Use Case: Brownfield Rewrite

**What we need:**
1. Analyze existing Agent Orchestration code (5% coverage, 216 violations)
2. Extract requirements, business logic, edge cases
3. Generate tests that validate existing behavior
4. Rewrite component using TDD
5. Validate feature parity with old implementation

**Spec-Kit workflow:**
```bash
# What Spec-Kit would require
/speckit.specify "Build an agent orchestration system..."  # Manual spec writing
/speckit.plan "Use Python, OpenAI SDK, Dapr Actors"       # Manual tech stack
/speckit.tasks                                             # Generate tasks
/speckit.implement                                         # Generate NEW code

# Problems:
# 1. We'd have to manually write specs (defeats automation purpose)
# 2. No way to extract requirements from existing code
# 3. No feature parity validation with old code
# 4. No test generation from existing implementation
```

### Spec-Kit Use Case: Greenfield Development

**What Spec-Kit is designed for:**
1. Describe new feature in natural language
2. Generate structured specification
3. Generate implementation plan
4. Generate code and tests
5. Deploy new feature

**Example (from docs):**
```bash
/speckit.specify "Build a task management app where users can create tasks..."
# → Generates spec.md with user stories, requirements
# → Generates plan.md with architecture
# → Generates tasks.md with implementation steps
# → Generates code with tests
```

**Verdict:** **Fundamental mismatch** - Spec-Kit is for building NEW features, not rewriting EXISTING ones

---

## Integration Feasibility

### Effort to Integrate Spec-Kit

**Installation & Setup:** 1-2 hours
```bash
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git
specify init tta-project --ai claude
# Configure for existing project
```

**Learning Curve:** 2-3 hours
- Understand spec-kit workflow
- Learn slash commands
- Configure for TTA project
- Understand quality gates

**Adaptation for Brownfield:** 5-10 hours (if even possible)
- Manually write specs for existing components
- Adapt workflow for rewrites
- Integrate with existing primitives
- Validate feature parity manually

**Total Effort:** **8-15 hours** (exceeds 5-7 hour budget)

**ROI:** **Negative** - More effort than building custom tools, less functionality

---

### Integration with Existing Infrastructure

**Compatibility Analysis:**

| TTA Infrastructure | Spec-Kit Integration | Effort | Benefit |
|-------------------|---------------------|--------|---------|
| **Gemini CLI** | Spec-Kit uses AI agents (Claude, Copilot, etc.) | Medium | Redundant - we already have Gemini |
| **Pre-commit Hooks** | Spec-Kit has quality gates | Low | Minimal - different enforcement points |
| **Workflow Orchestration** | Spec-Kit has its own workflow | High | Conflict - competing workflows |
| **AI Context Management** | Spec-Kit has constitution/memory | Medium | Redundant - we have context manager |
| **Error Recovery** | Spec-Kit has retry logic | Low | Redundant - we have error recovery |
| **Testing Infrastructure** | Spec-Kit generates tests | Medium | Incompatible - for new code only |

**Verdict:** **High integration complexity, low benefit**

## Quality Comparison

### Spec-Kit Approach vs. Gemini-Powered Approach

#### Test Generation

**Spec-Kit:**
```bash
# Generates tests for NEW code it creates
/speckit.implement
# → Creates src/component.py
# → Creates tests/test_component.py (for new code)
```

**Our Gemini Approach:**
```bash
# Generates tests from EXISTING code
./scripts/rewrite/generate_tests.sh src/old/component.py component
# → Analyzes existing implementation
# → Generates tests that validate existing behavior
# → Achieves 70%+ coverage of existing functionality
```

**Winner:** **Gemini approach** - Designed for our use case

#### Requirements Extraction

**Spec-Kit:**
```bash
# Requires manual spec writing
/speckit.specify "Build a component that does X, Y, Z..."
# → You write the spec manually
# → Spec-Kit structures it
```

**Our Gemini Approach:**
```bash
# Automates requirements extraction
./scripts/rewrite/extract_requirements.sh src/old/component/ component
# → Analyzes existing code automatically
# → Generates functional inventory
# → Extracts business logic
# → Discovers edge cases
```

**Winner:** **Gemini approach** - Fully automated vs. manual

#### Quality Gates

**Spec-Kit:**
```yaml
# Quality gates for generated code
quality_gates:
  - stage: build
    criteria:
      - test_pass_rate: 100
      - code_coverage: 80
```

**Our Approach:**
```yaml
# Enhanced pre-commit hooks for new code
pre-commit:
  - ruff-strict-new-code  # No print statements, type annotations required
  - require-type-annotations
  - prevent-anti-patterns
```

**Winner:** **Tie** - Different enforcement points, both valid

   - **Verdict:** ❌ No - We have GitHub Actions workflows
   - **Effort:** High
   - **Benefit:** Low (redundant)

**Hybrid Approach ROI:** **Negative** (high effort, low benefit)

---

## Final Recommendation

### ✅ **PROCEED WITH ORIGINAL PLAN**

**Reasons:**

1. **No Overlap** - Spec-Kit solves different problems (greenfield vs. brownfield)
2. **Wrong Tool** - Spec-Kit is for building NEW features, not rewriting EXISTING ones
3. **High Integration Cost** - 8-15 hours vs. 5-7 hours for custom tools
4. **Low Benefit** - Most Spec-Kit features not applicable to our use case
5. **Better ROI** - Custom Gemini tools: 6-10x ROI vs. Spec-Kit: negative ROI

**Original Plan:**
- Gemini-powered test generation (2-3h, saves 30-45h)
- Gemini-powered requirements extraction (2-3h, saves 15-24h)
- Enhanced pre-commit hooks (1h, prevents errors)
- **Total: 5-7 hours, saves 45-69 hours, ROI: 6-10x**

## Lessons Learned

### When Spec-Kit WOULD Be Useful

**Good Use Cases:**
1. **Greenfield Development** - Building new features from scratch
2. **Specification-First Projects** - Projects that start with detailed specs
3. **Multi-Agent Systems** - Building complex AI agent architectures
4. **Enterprise Governance** - Projects requiring strict quality gates and compliance

**Example:**
```bash
# Building a NEW feature for TTA
/speckit.specify "Add real-time collaboration to TTA sessions..."
/speckit.plan "Use WebSockets, Redis pub/sub, React hooks"
/speckit.implement
# → Generates new feature with tests
```

### When Spec-Kit WOULD NOT Be Useful

**Bad Use Cases:**
1. **Brownfield Rewrites** - Rewriting existing components (our use case)
2. **Requirements Extraction** - Analyzing existing code
3. **Test Generation from Existing Code** - Creating tests for legacy code
4. **Migration Projects** - Moving from old to new implementations

**Our Use Case:**
```bash
# Rewriting EXISTING Agent Orchestration component
# Spec-Kit can't help because:
# 1. Can't extract requirements from existing code
# 2. Can't generate tests from existing implementation
# 3. Can't validate feature parity
# 4. Designed for greenfield, not brownfield
```
