# Advanced Testing Infrastructure - Getting Started Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Complete Setup Roadmap

This guide walks you through setting up and using the advanced testing infrastructure step-by-step.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- GitHub repository access
- Slack workspace (for notifications)
- WSL2 environment (recommended)

---

## ðŸš€ Phase 1: Local Setup (15 minutes)

### Step 1.1: Install Playwright Browsers
```bash
cd /home/thein/recovered-tta-storytelling
npm run browsers:install
```
**What it does:** Downloads Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers (~500MB)
**Time:** ~5 minutes
**Note:** Only needed once, browsers are cached locally

### Step 1.2: Start Staging Environment
```bash
npm run staging:start
sleep 30
```
**What it does:** Starts Docker containers for Redis, Neo4j, PostgreSQL, and APIs
**Time:** ~2 minutes
**Verify:** Run `npm run staging:ps` to see running containers

### Step 1.3: Verify Setup
```bash
npm run staging:validate
```
**What it does:** Checks that all services are running and accessible
**Expected output:** All services should show as "healthy"

---

## ðŸ§ª Phase 2: Run Tests Locally (varies)

### Option A: Quick Test (3 minutes)
```bash
npm run test:staging:security
```
**Tests:** Security vulnerabilities only
**Good for:** Quick verification that setup works

### Option B: Load Testing (15 minutes)
```bash
npm run test:staging:load
```
**Tests:** 10, 25, and 50 concurrent users
**Good for:** Performance validation

### Option C: Chaos Engineering (5 minutes)
```bash
npm run test:staging:chaos
```
**Tests:** Network failures, timeouts, database disconnections
**Good for:** Resilience validation

### Option D: Visual Regression (10 minutes)
```bash
npm run test:staging:visual
```
**Tests:** UI consistency across browsers and viewports
**Good for:** UI regression detection

### Option E: All Advanced Tests (30 minutes)
```bash
npm run test:staging:advanced
```
**Tests:** All of the above combined
**Good for:** Comprehensive validation

### View Test Results
```bash
npm run test:staging:report
```
**What it does:** Opens HTML report in browser
**Shows:** Detailed test results, screenshots, videos

## ðŸ”” Phase 3: GitHub Setup (10 minutes)

### Step 3.1: Create Slack Webhook

1. Go to https://api.slack.com/apps
2. Click "Create New App" â†’ "From scratch"
3. Name: "TTA E2E Testing"
4. Select your workspace
5. Go to "Incoming Webhooks" â†’ Toggle ON
6. Click "Add New Webhook to Workspace"
7. Select channel (e.g., #testing)
8. Copy the webhook URL

### Step 3.2: Add to GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
3. Click "New repository secret"
4. Name: `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`
5. Value: Paste webhook URL from step 3.1
6. Click "Add secret"

### Step 3.3: Verify Workflow

1. Go to Actions tab
2. Find "E2E Staging - Advanced Testing"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select test type: "comprehensive"
5. Click "Run workflow"
6. Wait for completion (~30 minutes)
7. Check Slack for notification

## ðŸ“Š Phase 4: Monitor & Maintain (ongoing)

### Daily Checks
```bash
# Check staging health
npm run staging:ps

# View recent test results
npm run test:staging:report
```

### Weekly Tasks
```bash
# Run full test suite
npm run test:staging:all

# Check performance trends
# (View in GitHub Actions artifacts)
```

### Monthly Tasks
```bash
# Update visual regression baselines if UI changed
npm run test:staging:visual

# Review performance history
# (Check .github/performance-history.json)
```

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Before Merging PR
```bash
# 1. Run quick security check
npm run test:staging:security

# 2. Run load test
npm run test:staging:load

# 3. View results
npm run test:staging:report
```

### Workflow 2: After Deploying to Staging
```bash
# 1. Run all tests
npm run test:staging:all

# 2. Check for regressions
npm run test:staging:visual

# 3. Monitor performance
npm run test:staging:performance
```

### Workflow 3: Investigating Failures
```bash
# 1. Run specific test with debug output
npm run test:staging:debug

# 2. View detailed report
npm run test:staging:report

# 3. Check logs
npm run staging:logs
```

---

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Tests Timeout
**Solution:**
```bash
# Reduce concurrent users in load test
# Edit: tests/e2e-staging/helpers/load-testing-helpers.ts
# Change: concurrentUsers: 10 â†’ concurrentUsers: 5
```

### Issue: Slack Notifications Not Sending
**Solution:**
1. Verify `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` is set in GitHub Secrets
2. Test webhook manually:
```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{"text":"Test"}' \
  YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL
```

### Issue: Visual Regression Fails
**Solution:**
```bash
# Update baselines if UI intentionally changed
# Edit: tests/e2e-staging/13-visual-regression.staging.spec.ts
# Change: updateBaseline: false â†’ updateBaseline: true
# Run test, then change back to false
```

### Issue: Staging Services Won't Start
**Solution:**
```bash
# Stop and restart
npm run staging:stop
sleep 5
npm run staging:start
sleep 30

# Check logs
npm run staging:logs
```

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

1. **Use `--headed` flag to see browser:**
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --config=playwright.staging.config.ts \
     tests/e2e-staging/10-load-testing.staging.spec.ts --headed
   ```

2. **Use `--debug` flag to step through tests:**
   ```bash
   npm run test:staging:debug
   ```

3. **Use `--ui` flag for interactive mode:**
   ```bash
   npm run test:staging:ui
   ```

4. **Run specific test only:**
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --config=playwright.staging.config.ts \
     tests/e2e-staging/10-load-testing.staging.spec.ts \
     -g "should handle 10 concurrent users"
   ```
