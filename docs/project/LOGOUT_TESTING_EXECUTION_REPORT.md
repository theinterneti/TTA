# Logout Functionality Testing - Execution Report

## Date: 2025-10-17

## Executive Summary

Executed comprehensive E2E testing of logout functionality in TTA staging environment. Identified critical issue: **session cookie is not being cleared after logout**, preventing proper session termination.

## Test Execution Results

### Prerequisites Verification ‚úÖ

- **Frontend**: ‚úÖ Running at http://localhost:3001
- **API**: ‚úÖ Running at http://localhost:8081
- **Redis**: ‚úÖ Running on port 6380
- **Neo4j**: ‚úÖ Running on port 7688
- **PostgreSQL**: ‚úÖ Running on port 5433

### Test Suite Execution

**Test**: `should logout successfully` (Chromium)

**Status**: ‚ùå FAILED

**Test Steps**:
1. ‚úÖ Login with demo credentials - PASSED
2. ‚úÖ Capture session ID - PASSED (Session ID: YcEF1RpfD_HXVPPpoovm...)
3. ‚úÖ Logout initiated - PASSED
4. ‚úÖ Redirected to login page - PASSED
5. ‚ùå Session cookie is cleared - **FAILED**

**Error**:
```
Error: expect(received).toBeTruthy()
Received: false

Expected: Session cookie (openrouter_session_id) to be cleared
Actual: Session cookie still exists with value
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue Identified

The logout flow has a **critical mismatch between frontend and backend endpoints**:

1. **Frontend** (`src/player_experience/frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`):
   - Calls `authAPI.logout()` which uses `/api/v1/auth/logout`
   - This endpoint does NOT clear the `openrouter_session_id` cookie

2. **Backend** (`src/player_experience/api/routers/auth.py`):
   - `/api/v1/auth/logout` endpoint returns 500 errors
   - Does not properly clear the session cookie
   - Response object injection not working correctly

3. **Correct Endpoint** (`src/player_experience/api/routers/openrouter_auth.py`):
   - `/api/v1/openrouter/auth/logout` endpoint properly clears the cookie
   - Properly deletes session from Redis
   - Has comprehensive logging
   - **NOT being called by frontend**

### Backend Logs Evidence

```
INFO:     172.26.0.1:59216 - "POST /api/v1/auth/logout HTTP/1.1" 500 Internal Server Error
INFO:     172.26.0.1:59242 - "POST /api/v1/auth/logout HTTP/1.1" 500 Internal Server Error
INFO:     172.26.0.1:36304 - "POST /api/v1/auth/logout HTTP/1.1" 500 Internal Server Error
```

All logout requests return 500 errors.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Enhancement (`src/player_experience/api/routers/auth.py`)

Updated `/api/v1/auth/logout` endpoint to:
- Accept Response object for cookie manipulation
- Clear `openrouter_session_id` cookie
- Clear `session_id` cookie
- Add proper error handling

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Implemented but endpoint still returns 500 errors

### 2. Frontend Update (`src/player_experience/frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`)

Updated logout thunk to:
- Call `/api/v1/openrouter/auth/logout` instead of `/api/v1/auth/logout`
- Use fetch with `credentials: 'include'` for cookie handling

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Code updated but frontend container not picking up changes

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Docker Compose Configuration Error

```
services.deploy.replicas: can't set container_name and clinical-api as container name must be unique
```

Prevents rebuilding containers with `docker-compose up -d --build`

### 2. Frontend Build Cache

Frontend container not picking up code changes even after restart. Likely due to:
- Pre-built artifacts in `/app/build` directory
- Docker layer caching
- Frontend using old compiled code

### 3. Backend Response Injection

The `/api/v1/auth/logout` endpoint has issues with Response object injection in FastAPI, causing 500 errors.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix Docker Compose Configuration**
   - Resolve the `container_name` uniqueness issue
   - Allow proper container rebuilds

2. **Force Frontend Rebuild**
   - Clear Docker build cache
   - Rebuild frontend container with fresh code
   - Verify new endpoint is being called

3. **Fix Backend Logout Endpoint**
   - Either fix the `/api/v1/auth/logout` endpoint Response injection
   - OR update frontend to use `/api/v1/openrouter/auth/logout` (preferred)

### Preferred Solution

**Use the OpenRouter logout endpoint** (`/api/v1/openrouter/auth/logout`):
- Already properly implemented
- Correctly clears cookies
- Has comprehensive logging
- Properly deletes Redis sessions

**Frontend should call**: `/api/v1/openrouter/auth/logout`

## Test Results Summary

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Logout endpoint accessible | ‚úÖ | Both endpoints accessible |
| Session deleted from Redis | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Not verified due to cookie issue |
| Session cookie cleared | ‚ùå | **CRITICAL FAILURE** |
| User redirected to login | ‚úÖ | Redirect working correctly |
| Protected routes require auth | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Not tested due to cookie issue |
| Debug logging present | ‚úÖ | Comprehensive logging in place |

## Next Steps

1. Resolve Docker Compose configuration issue
2. Force rebuild of frontend container
3. Verify frontend is calling correct endpoint
4. Re-run E2E tests
5. Verify all success criteria are met

## Files Modified

- `src/player_experience/api/routers/auth.py` - Enhanced logout endpoint
- `src/player_experience/frontend/src/store/slices/authSlice.ts` - Updated to use correct endpoint
- `scripts/test-logout-flow.sh` - Fixed API health check

## Conclusion

The logout functionality has been partially implemented with proper backend support, but the frontend-backend integration is broken due to endpoint mismatch and Docker build issues. Once the Docker configuration is fixed and the frontend is rebuilt, the tests should pass.

**Status**: üî¥ **BLOCKED** - Awaiting Docker configuration fix and frontend rebuild
