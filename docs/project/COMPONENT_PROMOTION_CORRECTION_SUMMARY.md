## Priority 3: Narrative Arc Orchestrator Test Coverage Plan ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### Document Created

**`docs/component-promotion/NARRATIVE_ARC_ORCHESTRATOR_TEST_COVERAGE_PLAN.md`**

Comprehensive test plan to increase coverage from 42.9% to 70%+:

**Phase 1: scale_manager.py** (Priority: HIGH)
- Event creation logic tests
- Scale window calculation tests
- Conflict resolution tests
- Async initialization tests
- **Estimated gain**: +10-12%

**Phase 2: impact_analysis.py** (Priority: HIGH)
- Null handling tests
- Error handling tests
- Boundary condition tests
- **Estimated gain**: +8-10%

**Phase 3: causal_graph.py** (Priority: MEDIUM)
- Graph validation tests
- Cycle detection tests
- **Estimated gain**: +5-7%

**Timeline**:
- **Week 1 (2025-10-14 to 2025-10-20)**: Phase 1 - scale_manager.py tests
- **Week 2 (2025-10-21 to 2025-10-27)**: Phase 2 & 3 - impact_analysis.py and causal_graph.py tests
- **Target Completion**: 2025-10-27
- **Staging Deployment**: 2025-10-28 (after 70%+ coverage achieved)

**Estimated Effort**: 40-80 hours (1-2 weeks)
**Estimated New Tests**: 33-45 tests

---

## Priority 4: Documentation Sync Automation ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### Scripts Created

1. **`scripts/sync-component-docs.py`**
   - Python script to validate documentation consistency
   - Compares documentation files against component-maturity-analysis.json
   - Detects coverage discrepancies
   - Generates component metrics reports
   - Can be run in dry-run mode for validation only

   **Usage**:
   ```bash
   # Validate all documentation
   python3 scripts/sync-component-docs.py --dry-run

   # Check specific component
   python3 scripts/sync-component-docs.py --component "Narrative Arc Orchestrator"

   # Generate metrics report
   python3 scripts/sync-component-docs.py --report
   ```

2. **`scripts/validate-component-metrics.sh`**
   - Bash wrapper for pre-commit hook integration
   - Validates metrics consistency before commits
   - Provides clear error messages and fix instructions
   - Can be bypassed with `--no-verify` if needed

   **Usage**:
   ```bash
   # Run validation manually
   ./scripts/validate-component-metrics.sh

   # Add as pre-commit hook (future enhancement)
   # See .pre-commit-config.yaml
   ```

### Integration Plan

**Future Enhancement**: Add to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
```yaml
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: validate-component-metrics
      name: Validate component metrics consistency
      entry: scripts/validate-component-metrics.sh
      language: script
      pass_filenames: false
      files: ^(docs/component-promotion/.*\.md|component-maturity-analysis\.json)$
```

## Revised Component Priorities

### Current Priority Order (CORRECTED)

| Priority | Component | Coverage | Blockers | Status | Target Date |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------|--------|-------------|
| **P0** | **Carbon** | **70.6%** | **0** | **üü¢ READY NOW** | **2025-10-14** |
| **P1** | Model Management | 100% | 2 (code quality) | üî¥ Development | 2025-10-17 |
| **P1** | Gameplay Loop | 100% | 3 (code quality) | üî¥ Development | 2025-10-17 |
| **P2** | Narrative Arc Orchestrator | 42.9% | 1 (coverage gap) | üî¥ Development | 2025-10-27 |

### Previous Priority Order (INCORRECT)

| Priority | Component | Coverage (WRONG) | Status |
|----------|-----------|------------------|--------|
| ~~P0~~ | ~~Narrative Arc Orchestrator~~ | ~~70.3%~~ ‚ùå | ~~Ready~~ ‚ùå |
| ~~P1~~ | ~~Model Management~~ | ~~100%~~ | ~~Development~~ |
| ~~P1~~ | ~~Gameplay Loop~~ | ~~100%~~ | ~~Development~~ |

**Why the Change**: The 70.3% coverage figure for Narrative Arc Orchestrator was never accurate. It came from an outdated investigation document (2025-10-09) that was never verified against the automated reporting system.

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong

1. **Unverified Data Propagation**: A coverage figure from an investigation document (70.3%) was copied into planning documents without verification
2. **No Single Source of Truth**: Multiple documents contained conflicting data with no clear authority
3. **Manual Documentation Drift**: Documentation was updated manually without automated validation
4. **Lack of Verification**: Coverage claims were not cross-checked against automated reporting

### Preventive Measures Implemented

1. **‚úÖ Single Source of Truth Established**: GitHub Issue #42 (automated daily) is now the authoritative source
2. **‚úÖ Automated Validation**: Created scripts to detect documentation inconsistencies
3. **‚úÖ Clear Correction Notices**: All outdated documents marked with prominent warnings
4. **‚úÖ Verification Workflow**: All future coverage claims must be verified against GitHub Issue #42

### Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Always verify coverage claims** against GitHub Issue #42 or component-maturity-analysis.json
2. **Run validation script** before committing documentation changes
3. **Trust automated reporting** over manual documentation
4. **Add correction notices** to outdated documents rather than deleting them
5. **Use pre-commit hooks** to prevent documentation drift
