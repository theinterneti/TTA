## Configuration Sections Removed

### From `pyproject.toml`

#### 1. Black Configuration (Removed)
```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 88
target-version = ['py310']
include = '\.pyi?$'
extend-exclude = '''
/(
  # directories

time pre-commit run --all-files
# Result: 6.849 seconds (55% faster than before)
```

### 3. Convenience Script Test
```bash
./scripts/dev.sh help
# Result: Successfully displays all available commands
```

### 4. Ruff Configuration Test
```bash
uv run ruff check src/ tests/
# Result: Successfully runs with new expanded rule set
```

## Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

If you need to rollback these changes:

### 1. Restore Dependencies

```

### 2. Restore Configuration
```bash
# Restore [tool.black] and [tool.isort] sections in pyproject.toml
# Revert [tool.ruff] to previous minimal configuration

# Run: pre-commit install
```

### 4. Restore CI/CD Jobs

```

### 5. Remove New Files
```bash
rm scripts/dev.sh
rm docs/tooling-optimization-summary.md
rm docs/dev-workflow-quick-reference.md
