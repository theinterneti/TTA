## üöÄ Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)

#### 1. Approve Carbon Promotion (Priority: CRITICAL)

**Action**: Review and approve [Issue #24](https://github.com/theinterneti/TTA/issues/24)

**Verification**:
```bash
# Verify all checks still pass
uv run pytest tests/test_components.py --cov=src/components/carbon_component.py --cov-report=term
uvx ruff check src/components/carbon_component.py
uvx pyright src/components/carbon_component.py
uvx bandit -r src/components/carbon_component.py -ll
```

**Impact**: Validates entire maturity promotion workflow

---

#### 2. Start Narrative Coherence (Priority: HIGH)

**Why Next**: Smallest linting count (433 issues), no security issues

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days

**Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Fix linting (auto-fix most)
uvx ruff check --fix src/components/narrative_coherence/

# 2. Fix remaining linting
uvx ruff check src/components/narrative_coherence/

# 3. Fix type checking
uvx pyright src/components/narrative_coherence/

# 4. Create README
touch src/components/narrative_coherence/README.md
# Add: overview, features, usage examples, API docs

# 5. Verify all checks
uvx ruff check src/components/narrative_coherence/
uvx pyright src/components/narrative_coherence/
uvx bandit -r src/components/narrative_coherence/ -ll

# 6. Create promotion request
gh issue create --template component_promotion.yml
```

**Blocker Issue**: [#23](https://github.com/theinterneti/TTA/issues/23)

---

#### 3. Continue with Gameplay Loop (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Why Third**: More linting issues (1,247), but no security concerns

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**Steps**: Same as Narrative Coherence (above)

**Blocker Issue**: [#22](https://github.com/theinterneti/TTA/issues/22)

---

#### 4. Finish with Model Management (Priority: MEDIUM-HIGH)

**Why Last**: Security issues require careful testing

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

**Critical**: Fix Hugging Face security issues first
```python
# Pin model revisions
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    revision="commit-hash"  # Specific commit
)
```

**Blocker Issue**: [#21](https://github.com/theinterneti/TTA/issues/21)

---

### Week 1 Goal

**Target**: 4 components in staging

**Timeline**:
- Day 1: ‚úÖ Carbon (COMPLETE)
- Day 2-3: Narrative Coherence
- Day 4-6: Gameplay Loop
- Day 7-9: Model Management

**Success Criteria**: All 4 P0 components promoted to staging by end of Week 1

---

### Medium-term (Week 2-3)

#### P1 Components

After P0 components are in staging, focus on P1 components:

| Component | Coverage | Gap to 70% | Estimated Effort |
|-----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| **Narrative Arc Orchestrator** | 47.1% | -22.9% | 2-3 days |
| **LLM** | 28.2% | -41.8% | 3-4 days |
| **Neo4j** | 27.2% | -42.8% | 3-4 days |
| **Docker** | 20.1% | -49.9% | 4-5 days |
| **Player Experience** | 17.3% | -52.7% | 4-5 days |

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks for all P1 components

---

### Long-term (Week 4-8)

#### P2 Components

| Component | Coverage | Gap to 70% | Estimated Effort |
|-----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| **Agent Orchestration** | 2.0% | -68.0% | 5-6 days |
| **Character Arc Manager** | 0% | -70% | 6-7 days |
| **Therapeutic Systems** | 0% | -70% | 6-7 days |

**Timeline**: 4-5 weeks for all P2 components

---

## üìà Overall Project Timeline

### Revised Timeline (Based on Corrected Analysis)

**Original Estimate**: 11-12 weeks
**Corrected Estimate**: **7-8 weeks** (30-40% faster!)

### Breakdown

| Phase | Duration | Components | Status |
|-------|----------|------------|--------|
| **Week 1** | 1 week | P0 (4 components) | üîÑ In Progress (1/4 complete) |
| **Week 2-3** | 2-3 weeks | P1 (5 components) | ‚è≥ Pending |
| **Week 4-8** | 4-5 weeks | P2 (3 components) | ‚è≥ Pending |

**Total**: 7-8 weeks to all components in staging

---

## üéì Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. ‚úÖ **Correction Process**: Quickly identified and fixed analysis error
2. ‚úÖ **Transparency**: Clear communication about what went wrong
3. ‚úÖ **Quick Win**: Carbon component completed in ~2 hours as estimated
4. ‚úÖ **Workflow Validation**: Entire maturity promotion process works as designed

### What to Improve

1. üîß **Tool Selection**: Always use `uv run pytest` for project tests (not `uvx pytest`)
2. üîß **Verification**: Question unexpected results (0% across the board was a red flag)
3. üîß **Label Management**: Some GitHub labels don't exist (e.g., `promotion:ready`)

### Key Takeaways

- **Test coverage is much better than initially reported** (3 at 100%, 1 at 69.7%)
- **Main blocker is code quality, not tests** (linting/type checking)
- **Timeline is 30-40% faster than originally estimated**
- **Quick wins are possible** (Carbon: 2 hours from analysis to promotion request)
