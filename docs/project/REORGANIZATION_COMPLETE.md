## ✅ Validation Results

### Structure Validation: PASS

```
[✓] All required directories created
[✓] Archive structure complete (76 files)

## 🔍 Issues and Resolutions

### Issue 1: Script Exiting Early ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem:** Script was exiting after first missing file due to `set -e` and `return 1`.

**Solution:** Changed `return 1` to `return 0` in move_file function.

**Status:** ✅ Fixed and tested

### Issue 2: Docker Compose Dev Config ⚠️ MINOR

**Problem:** Duplicate security_opt in docker-compose.dev.yml.

**Impact:** Non-critical, doesn't prevent usage.

**Action Required:** Fix duplicate entry in docker-compose.dev.yml.

### Issue 3: Analytics Compose File ❓ REVIEW NEEDED

**Problem:** Unclear if docker-compose.analytics.yml is still in use.

**Action Required:** Review usage and either keep or move to obsolete/.
