| Underestimated complexity | **MEDIUM** | MEDIUM | 20% buffer, iterative approach |
| Integration breakage | **LOW** | HIGH | Maintain API contracts |
| Rewriting working code (Carbon) | **HIGH** | LOW | Wastes time on already-good code |

**Overall Risk:** **MEDIUM-HIGH** ⚠️

#### HYBRID Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
